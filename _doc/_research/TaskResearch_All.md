# Why do people procrastinate? a list of 100+ reasons | Amazing Marvin

> ## Excerpt
> Why do people procrastinate?

Let's face it we all procrastinate sometimes (or often), even though we don't want to.

We might even be fully aware of how much it is hurting us.

So why do we procrastinate, when rationally it makes no sense to do so?

In short: emotions...

While we like to think of ourselves as rational beings (thanks prefrontal cortex!) our emotions still greatly influence our behavior.

When a task elicits negative emotions in us, we want to avoid the task. It is our natural instinct to avoid things that trigger negative emotions. The whole point of negative emotions is to help us avoid danger and problems!

We are driven to do what feels good to us in the moment. That is the basic and ancient motivation mechanism of our brain.

Unfortunately for us, there are lots of ways a task can make us feel bad and trigger that age-old avoidance instinct, even though most tasks have no risk of actually killing us or even greatly harming us.

Sometimes it's the actual task that is unpleasant and makes us feel bad.

Other times it's the potential outcome of the task that triggers a negative emotion. It can also happen that we just have a negative association with that task that is causing us to feel bad about it.

Most often it's a mix of things that triggers the negative emotions.

Usually, we are not aware of exactly why we are avoiding something. We just experience the resistance. That gnarly feeling that just makes you want to do anything but the dreaded task. Some people are very aware of the resistance and others just avoid things instinctively without even realizing they are avoiding something.

If there is a task you procrastinate again and again it can help to try and uncover what about this task triggers negative emotions in you. Sometimes that is enough to make you realize how irrational your instinct to avoid the task is and you can then consciously override this instinct and get started on the task.

Other times, being aware of what exactly triggers the negative emotions provides valuable insight into something you should work on: an unhealthy mindset or an unresolved problem.

And sometimes you might realize that you actually do have a really good reason for not wanting to do a task and you should not attempt to do that task in the first place.

Below you will find a list of 127 nuanced reasons why a task might trigger procrastination.

If there is a task you are avoiding right now, go through the list and see if something hits a nerve.

# The water baby method of fighting procrastination | Amazing Marvin

> ## Excerpt
> Procrastination is a complex beast.

But it is far from an automatic death sentence for your dreams and aspirations. Even if it often feels that way.

No matter how bad your procrastination is, how ingrained the habit is and why you do it there is hope.  Procrastination can be fixed.
If you are serious about overcoming procrastination
If you are serious about overcoming your procrastination long-term I highly encourage you to

 take the time to really understand procrastination in general
 dig deep on your own procrastination patterns
 follow a clear action plan for overcoming the habit

I am working on a 3 month online procrastination bootcamp that is designed to help you with all of that step by step. It will attack procrastination from multiple angles and used proven methods I used to help tons of people overcome their procrastination habit.
Ain't nobody got time for this
However, I get asked all the time about a simple trick or strategy that can help you stop procrastinating right now.

Something easy that can be used anytime and does not require any extra effort or time.

And honestly, I don't blame procrastinators for wanting a quick fix. As a procrastinator you already wasted so much time. It feels like there just isn't any time or energy left to fix the actual problem!

So here comes one of my favorite anti-procrastination strategies: the water baby method.

The water baby method is as close to a universal solution as it gets. It works for practically any task and anyone can use it, no matter why you are procrastinating.

And most importantly, it tackles the procrastination problem from multiple angles which makes it extremely effective.


Limitations of the water baby method for fighting procrastination
There is one limitation to this method, however.

You can only use this method if you catch yourself in the act of procrastinating.

Let me explain.

Many people know that they procrastinate a lot.  But sometimes it's just a general sense you have because things don't get done or you have a lot of vivid recollections of times where you did work last minute in a frenzy to meet a deadline.
The procrastination moment
But procrastination is all about the exact moment when one part of you knows it would be a good time to do "insert super important task here", but you don't do it for no good reason other than that inner resistance you feel to getting started on the task.

This moment is usually extremely brief and a lot of times we aren't even aware it is happening.

Procrastination can be such an ingrained habit that our whole day just plays out on auto-pilot leading us to avoid our dreaded tasks without us ever really thinking about what we are doing.

So if you want to use the water baby method effectively, you need to first set up a system that will allow you to more easily catch yourself in the very moment you procrastinate:  That key moment where you delay getting started on a task because you just don't feel like it!
Setting up a procrastination awareness system
The easiest way to become more aware of your procrastination is to write a to-do list for your day the night before. It's key that you write it the day before and not right before you want to do some work.

Having some time between "deciding what to do" and "having to do something" you are much more likely to use your rational part of the brain in deciding what would be a good idea to tackle tomorrow instead of your emotional brain ("what do I want to do right now?")

It also helps if you decide ahead of time on a specific order in which to do the tasks. Put the one you want to do first at the top.

And finally, write down when you will start working on the list.
Write tasty tasks
And to make it easier for you to do the tasks (besides the water baby method), follow these three rules for task writing to make your tasks more appealing.

You now built the perfect trap to catch yourself in the act.

The next day you will simply try to follow your plan by starting on the first task in your list at your designated start time.

And be aware of excuses! Procrastination isn't hurting anyone but yourself. And only when you recognize and can admit to yourself what is really going on when you delay a task can you do something about it.
Water Baby Method of overcoming Procrastination
Picture this scenario
The whole method relies on an analogy of a baby taking a bath (hence the name).

Analogies are helpful for remembering something in detail and drive home the main points.

I want you to picture a little baby (or a puppy if you don't like babies). You are the parent and you want to give the baby her first bath. You filled a bathtub with a little bit of warm water and are holding the baby, ready to place him in the bathtub.

As a loving parent you know becoming familiar with water is an important step in the babies development and ultimately good for the baby. Plus the baby is pretty dirty and needs a good wash...

However, the baby doesn't know any of that!

It has no concept of long-term benefits. It is simply terrified of the look of that strange water in the bathtub. The baby instinctually tries to avoid getting into that bath. It cries, screams and digs his little hands into your skin: anything to avoid touching that water.

What do you do in that situation?

Accept that the baby has decided it does not want to touch water and resolve that you now have a child that will be forever a bit stinky? I hope not!

You likely know that as soon as the baby calms down a bit and gets used to the water it will most likely be OK with it. The water isn't hurting the baby. And long-term this is the best thing for the baby.

So you persist and try to help the baby feel calm and get used to the water in small steps to show him there isn't anything to be afraid of.

You probably wouldn't just throw the baby in the bathtub. You might splash some water gently on its hand to get it to realize the water won't hurt him. Maybe dip her toes into the water. If the water truly seems to cause the baby pain you try to adjust the temperature to make it as comfortable as possible.

You show compassion for the baby who is experiencing real fear.

You know that if you give in in that moment and won't even let the baby touch the water, you are basically telling the baby it is correct to fear the water. And next time you will be dealing with the same situation. So you don't give up until that baby is clean and had a good or at least neutral experience with the water so next time it will be easier to get the baby in the water.
Your brain at conflict: procrastination
The baby and parent are two parts of your brain:

 Parent: the modern, rational and long-term thinking part of your brain (prefrontal cortex aka rational decision maker).
 Baby: the ancient, emotional-driven part of your brain that only cares about surviving (amygdala/limbic system aka lizard brain).

The scenario above is precisely what happens inside your brain when you are facing a task you are likely to delay.

If a task elicits any negative emotion in us, the first instinct of the lizard brain is to try and avoid it.

The problem is that we usually have a reason for wanting to do a task. Whether it is to reach a goal, keep our job or not pay late fees. But only our rational decision maker understands these long-term consequences and benefits of the task.

Our ancient brain is only focused on survival. And if something is unpleasant or unfamiliar chances are we are better off avoiding it. It likes to stick to things that we know are safe and offer a high reward relative to the energy expenditure it takes to do a task. You know, things like eating, sex, browsing the Internet and playing those addictive mobile games.

So how do we get anything done?

The good news is that your pre-frontal cortex has the ability to override those ancient instincts. And do things despite our ancient brain protesting.

Whether you end up procrastinating or tackling the task you are faced with depends on who wins: the prefrontal cortex or the lizard brain.

Think of it like an equation. The bigger side wins. It all depends on how strong or well trained your prefrontal cortex is in that moment in relation to how strong your lizard brain response to a task is.

But it often happens so quickly and subconsciously that you might not even be aware of it.

The important key piece of why the method works is that the lizard brains job is to protect you and it tends to err on the side of caution. It's also a bit of a drama queen. If there is just a hint of uncomfortableness around a task it might think this task will kill you and try to get you to avoid it at all cost (Better safe than sorry...).

Obviously, most tasks don't kill us and almost every time they are not even as close to as bad as we think.
How to apply the water baby method
The key point is that you should treat yourself just like you would treat the baby afraid of water when you are about to procrastinate:
Staying put (don't move!)
When you see it's time to work on a task and you can feel that uncomfortable feeling rising inside of you, the resistance building immediately think of the baby water scenario and stay put.

I repeat. Stay put. Don't move.

In that moment,  we often have an immediate urge to calm or distract ourselves: open a tab in our browser,  pick up our phone to check or play something, walk to the fridge to get a snack or start on another easier task.

But if you walk away now and start on another activity you are reinforcing the procrastination pattern. You are basically rewarding the avoidance behavior, making it more likely the same thing will happen again next time.

It's like giving a dog a treat right after he poops on the floor. He will link the two behaviors and associate positive things with something that isn't positive at all.

If you play a game or browse your favorite site (high reward for the brain) right after avoiding a task, you are rewarding procrastination.

So by just doing nothing instead you are breaking the cycle.

There are three key things that happen when you stay put:

 you are not reinforcing the avoidance behavior
 you are letting yourself experience negative emotions (instead of immediately distracting yourself), which builds tolerance long-term
 you created an opportunity to engage your pre-frontal cortex and override the default response (which happens in a split second)

Becoming aware
Try to stay calm and take a deep breath. Bring your awareness to what is going on right now. Congratulate yourself for catching yourself in the act and creating this opportunity to do something about your procrastination.

Remember to be kind to yourself. Be grateful for the brain part that is trying to protect you (even though it is misguided) from an unpleasant task. And have compassion for yourself. You are likely feeling very uncomfortable right now. Perhaps you can feel the stress or fear in your body, perhaps it is too subtle to notice. But there are stress hormones circulating around and your amygdala is creating negative emotions to try and get you to avoid the task it thinks is dangerous for you.

The next point is crucial, if you decide to just do the whole task and ignore the part of you that feels uncomfortable, you might scare yourself even more and it becomes all too much and you give in to the self soothing behavior.
Focus on "getting started"
Instead, make a deal with yourself to just dip your toes in the water.

Resolve to get started and just try working on the task for 5min (or whatever time limit feels safe). If it really feels as bad as your lizard brain tells you it will, you can stop.

Reframe things in your mind from "doing the task" to "trying the task". The goal right now is not to finish anything. The only goal right now is to try and get started on the task despite the resistance you feel.

Again, the only goal right now is to get started on the task. Even if it is just for a minute.

Actually moving ahead and getting started on the task will really break the procrastination pattern instead of reinforcing it.

Going ahead with the unpleasant task will strengthen your pre-frontal cortex pathways responsible for overriding your emotional response. This will benefit you long-term.

Getting started on the task will also show your lizard brain that the task is safe to do making it elicit a lesser fear response next time.

The beautiful thing is that a task is practically never as bad as we think it is before we get started. So as you get into it, you will calm down and perhaps even enjoy working on it. Your lizard brain will remember this and next time around the resistance it generates will be much smaller.

Congratulate yourself every time you can effectively overcome the resistance and get started on a task you instinctively want to procrastinate. This is huge! You are now well on your way of improving your procrastination.

Again, the key is to become aware of that tiny moment where you are tempted to turn away from a task and get started on it instead. Try to do this multiple times a day and your procrastination habit will get weaker and weaker, putting you back in the driver's seat of your life.
The importance of compassion
Remember to always be compassionate and kind to yourself every time you don't manage to override the resistance. It takes time to rewire our brains! You are not going to be successful at doing this every time. Just try your best. Praise yourself when it works and offer compassion when it does not.

The worst thing you can do is beating yourself up over not succeeding. That just scares your poor lizard brain even more making it more reactive. There are a ton of studies that show being kind and compassionate with yourself (the opposite of beating yourself up, negative self-talk and being hard on yourself) is one of the key things in overcoming procrastination.

Remember: being hard on yourself makes your procrastination worse. So don't do it!
Why is the water baby method so effective for overcoming procrastination?
The reason why this mental model is so effective is because it combines multiple of the most important aspects of beating procrastination:

 self-compassion
 understanding the cause of procrastination (lizard brain being scared trying to protect you)
 breaking the pattern (not rewarding procrastination!)
 strengthening the pathways needed to self-regulate and override instincts by getting started despite the resistance

The more you do this, the quicker you will get better. It's all about practice. But don't sweat it when you can't stick to the method or forget to apply it for long stretches of time. Just resolve to try again. Physical reminders like sticky notes on your computer can also be helpful to remind you to practice the water baby method.

Summary
Step by Step summary of the water baby method

 Stay put, don't move.
 Think of the water baby scenario in detail and relate it to your situation
 Show understanding and compassion for the part of you that wants to avoid the task
 Remember that the task is likely not as bad as you think once you get started

Procrastination is a complex beast.

But it is far from an automatic death sentence for your dreams and aspirations. Even if it often feels that way.

No matter how bad your procrastination is, how ingrained the habit is and why you do it there is hope.  Procrastination can be fixed.

## If you are serious about overcoming procrastination

**If you are serious about overcoming your procrastination long-term** I highly encourage you to

-   take the time to really understand procrastination in general
-   dig deep on your own procrastination patterns
-   follow a clear action plan for overcoming the habit

I am working on a 3 month [online procrastination bootcamp](https://www.amazingmarvin.com/procrastination-bootcamp.html) that is designed to help you with all of that step by step. It will attack procrastination from multiple angles and used proven methods I used to help tons of people overcome their procrastination habit.

#### Ain’t nobody got time for this

However, I get asked all the time about **a simple trick or strategy that can help you stop procrastinating** _right now_.

Something easy that can be used anytime and does not require any extra effort or time.

And honestly, I don’t blame procrastinators for wanting a quick fix. As a procrastinator you already wasted so much time. It feels like there just isn’t any time or energy left to fix the actual problem!

So here comes one of my favorite anti-procrastination strategies: the water baby method.

The water baby method is as close to a universal solution as it gets. It works for practically any task and anyone can use it, no matter [why you are procrastinating.](https://blog.amazingmarvin.com/100-reasons-why-we-procrastinate/)

And most importantly, it tackles the procrastination problem from multiple angles which makes it extremely effective.

The water baby method for beating procrastination

## Limitations of the water baby method for fighting procrastination

There is one limitation to this method, however.

You can only use this method if you **catch yourself in the act of procrastinating**.

Let me explain.

Many people know that they procrastinate a lot.  But sometimes it’s just a general sense you have because things don’t get done or you have a lot of vivid recollections of times where you did work last minute in a frenzy to meet a deadline.

#### The procrastination moment

But procrastination is all about the exact moment when one part of you knows it would be a good time to do “insert super important task here”, but you don’t do it for no good reason other than that inner resistance you feel to getting started on the task.

This moment is usually extremely brief and a lot of times we aren’t even aware it is happening.

Procrastination can be such an ingrained habit that our whole day just plays out on auto-pilot leading us to avoid our dreaded tasks without us ever really thinking about what we are doing.

So if you want to use the water baby method effectively, you need to first set up a system that will allow you to more easily catch yourself in the very moment you procrastinate:  **That key moment where you delay getting started on a task because you just don’t feel like it!**

## Setting up a procrastination awareness system

The easiest way to become more aware of your procrastination is to **write a to-do list for your day the night before**. It’s key that you write it the day before and not right before you want to do some work.

Having some time between “deciding what to do” and “having to do something” you are much more likely to use your rational part of the brain in deciding what would be a good idea to tackle tomorrow instead of your emotional brain (“what do I _want_ to do right now?”)

It also helps if you decide ahead of time on a specific order in which to do the tasks. Put the one you want to do first at the top.

And finally, write down _when_ you will start working on the list.

#### Write tasty tasks

And to make it easier for you to do the tasks (besides the water baby method), [follow these three rules for task writing to make your tasks more appealing](https://blog.amazingmarvin.com/three-simple-rules-writing-great-tasks-to-do-list/).

You now built the perfect trap to catch yourself in the act.

The next day you will simply try to follow your plan by starting on the first task in your list at your designated start time.

And be aware of excuses! Procrastination isn’t hurting anyone but yourself. And only when you recognize and can admit to yourself what is really going on when you delay a task can you do something about it.

## Water Baby Method of overcoming Procrastination

## Picture this scenario

The whole method relies on an analogy of a baby taking a bath (hence the name).

Analogies are helpful for remembering something in detail and drive home the main points.

I want you to picture a little baby (or a puppy if you don’t like babies). You are the parent and you want to give the baby her first bath. You filled a bathtub with a little bit of warm water and are holding the baby, ready to place him in the bathtub.

As a loving parent you know becoming familiar with water is an important step in the babies development and ultimately good for the baby. Plus the baby is pretty dirty and needs a good wash…

However, the baby doesn’t know any of that!

It has no concept of long-term benefits. It is simply terrified of the look of that strange water in the bathtub. The baby instinctually tries to avoid getting into that bath. It cries, screams and digs his little hands into your skin: anything to avoid touching that water.

What do you do in that situation?

Accept that the baby has decided it does not want to touch water and resolve that you now have a child that will be forever a bit stinky? I hope not!

You likely know that as soon as the baby calms down a bit and gets used to the water it will most likely be OK with it. The water isn’t hurting the baby. And long-term this is the best thing for the baby.

So you persist and try to help the baby feel calm and get used to the water in small steps to show him there isn’t anything to be afraid of.

You probably wouldn’t just throw the baby in the bathtub. You might splash some water gently on its hand to get it to realize the water won’t hurt him. Maybe dip her toes into the water. If the water truly seems to cause the baby pain you try to adjust the temperature to make it as comfortable as possible.

**You show compassion for the baby who is experiencing real fear.**

You know that **if you give in in that moment and won’t even let the baby touch the water, you are basically telling the baby it is correct to fear the water**. And next time you will be dealing with the same situation. So you don’t give up until that baby is clean and had a good or at least neutral experience with the water so next time it will be easier to get the baby in the water.

## Your brain at conflict: procrastination

The baby and parent are two parts of your brain:

-   Parent: the modern, rational and long-term thinking part of your brain (prefrontal cortex aka rational decision maker).
-   Baby: the ancient, emotional-driven part of your brain that only cares about surviving (amygdala/limbic system aka lizard brain).

The scenario above is precisely what happens inside your brain when you are facing a task you are likely to delay.

**If a task elicits any negative emotion in us, the first instinct of the lizard brain is to try and avoid it.**

The problem is that we usually have a reason for wanting to do a task. Whether it is to reach a goal, keep our job or not pay late fees. But only our rational decision maker understands these long-term consequences and benefits of the task.

Our ancient brain is only focused on survival. And if something is unpleasant or unfamiliar chances are we are better off avoiding it. It likes to stick to things that we know are safe and offer a high reward relative to the energy expenditure it takes to do a task. You know, things like eating, sex, browsing the Internet and playing those addictive mobile games.

So how do we get anything done?

The good news is that **your pre-frontal cortex has the ability to override those ancient instincts**. And do things despite our ancient brain protesting.

Whether you end up procrastinating or tackling the task you are faced with depends on who wins: the prefrontal cortex or the lizard brain.

Think of it like an equation. The bigger side wins. It all depends on how strong or well trained your prefrontal cortex is in that moment in relation to how strong your lizard brain response to a task is.

But it often happens so quickly and subconsciously that you might not even be aware of it.

The important key piece of why the method works is that the lizard brains job is to protect you and it tends to err on the side of caution. It’s also a bit of a drama queen. If there is just a hint of uncomfortableness around a task it might think this task will kill you and try to get you to avoid it at all cost (Better safe than sorry…).

Obviously, most tasks don’t kill us and almost every time they are not even as close to as bad as we think.

## How to apply the water baby method

The key point is that you should treat yourself just like you would treat the baby afraid of water when you are about to procrastinate:

#### Staying put (don’t move!)

When you see it’s time to work on a task and you can feel that uncomfortable feeling rising inside of you, the resistance building **immediately think of the baby water scenario and stay put**.

I repeat. Stay put. Don’t move.

In that moment,  we often have an immediate urge to calm or distract ourselves: open a tab in our browser,  pick up our phone to check or play something, walk to the fridge to get a snack or start on another easier task.

**But if you walk away now and start on another activity you are reinforcing the procrastination pattern.** You are basically rewarding the avoidance behavior, making it more likely the same thing will happen again next time.

It’s like giving a dog a treat right after he poops on the floor. He will link the two behaviors and associate positive things with something that isn’t positive at all.

If you play a game or browse your favorite site (high reward for the brain) right after avoiding a task, you are rewarding procrastination.

So by just doing nothing instead you are breaking the cycle.

There are three key things that happen when you stay put:

-   you are not reinforcing the avoidance behavior
-   you are letting yourself experience negative emotions (instead of immediately distracting yourself), which builds tolerance long-term
-   you created an opportunity to engage your pre-frontal cortex and override the default response (which happens in a split second)

#### Becoming aware

Try to stay calm and take a deep breath. Bring your awareness to what is going on right now. Congratulate yourself for catching yourself in the act and creating this opportunity to do something about your procrastination.

Remember to be kind to yourself. Be grateful for the brain part that is trying to protect you (even though it is misguided) from an unpleasant task. And have compassion for yourself. You are likely feeling very uncomfortable right now. Perhaps you can feel the stress or fear in your body, perhaps it is too subtle to notice. But there are stress hormones circulating around and your amygdala is creating negative emotions to try and get you to avoid the task it thinks is dangerous for you.

The next point is crucial, if you decide to just do the whole task and ignore the part of you that feels uncomfortable, you might scare yourself even more and it becomes all too much and you give in to the self soothing behavior.

#### Focus on “getting started”

Instead, make a deal with yourself to just dip your toes in the water.

Resolve to get started and just try working on the task for 5min (or whatever time limit feels safe). If it really feels as bad as your lizard brain tells you it will, you can stop.

**Reframe things in your mind from “doing the task” to “trying the task”**. The goal right now is not to finish anything. The only goal right now is to try and get started on the task despite the resistance you feel.

Again, the only goal right now is to get started on the task. Even if it is just for a minute.

# 5 creative ways to use labels in your to-do app | Amazing Marvin

> ## Excerpt
> Labels are probably one of the most commonly used features in a to-do app. While there are some great standard use cases for labels, let's have a look at some more creative ways to use labels to help you get more done.
Beware of over-labeling!
But first a little warning: over-labeling is a real thing. It's super easy to go overboard with labeling and tagging every item with multiple labels. This can make your workflow more time consuming and complex than it has to be.

Feel free to try a new labeling system for a bit if you feel like you haven't found what works well for you yet or you are in need of switching things up a bit to make things interesting again (ADHD!). But whenever you add a new label, go through your list of labels and see if you can delete anything that is no longer being used.

In Amazing Marvin you can quickly delete a label in the labels settings and it will remove it from all items.


5 creative use cases for labels
So let's dive into these 5 creative label-use examples:

 Physical
 Fun
 Weighing on me
 Urgency
 Emotions

1. Physical
If you are like me and work on the computer most of the day it can be nice to mark tasks that involve some physical activity so you can intersperse those with your other tasks to not be constantly sitting around.

After all, sitting is the new smoking...
Examples of physical tasks:
When working from home this could be household chores or healthy habits like stretching, back exercises or taking a quick walk.

Be creative with this one, even a phone call or chatting with someone can be physical (just walk around/stand while doing it!).

Tagging tasks like this as @physical it will help remind you to do these things while moving.

If you have a standing desk you can also mark tasks that require less focus with @standing to remind yourself to perform these tasks while standing.
Integrating @physical labels into your workflow:
Creating a Smart List with @physical tasks always gives you a list to pick from when you feel yourself in need of some movement.

You could even set an hourly timer to remind yourself to do a physical task next. Moving at least once every hour is the current recommendation for optimal health.
2. Fun
Personally, I really like to keep a @fun tag and apply it any task that I feel kind of excited about.

There are probably some things on your to-do list that you look forward to more than others and having a nice list of "fun" tasks to do when motivation is low helps you to not sink into complete inactivity.

Another benefit is that labeling a task as fun helps to remind you that even if this tasks might never be as "fun" as binge watching Netflix with a tub of ice cream, work can (and often should!) still be fun in its own way.
3. Weighing on me
This is another personal favorite of mine.

If you suffer from procrastination or anxiety, it's absolutely crucial to regularly check in with yourself and do an assessment of what is weighing on you right now.

Often there are lots of things weighing us down that we can do something about (our tasks!).

Dreaded tasks have a way of piling up. And even when you do our best to avoid thinking about them, they are always in the back of your mind somewhere. Feeling the constant weight of all those tasks can really decrease your productivity and motivation.
Integrating "weighing on me" labels into your workflow
So make sure you schedule time each week or month to perform this little "exercise" or do it whenever you feel overwhelmed:

Take a moment and sit down with your tasks. Identify what is really burdening you right now. Hint: it's those things that make your heart go faster when you think about them (not in a good way!) or the things that pop up at random when you try to sleep.

Add a @weight or @weighingMeDown label to those tasks and projects and create a Smart List for them. Then try to tackle at least one thing a day, step by step you will feel so much lighter.
4. Urgency
For a lot of us only very few tasks have a strict deadline (e.g. taxes or someone's Birthday). But even without a deadline some items are more urgent than others.

Labels can come in handy here to add some urgency differentiation to tasks that don't have strict deadlines.
Integrating urgency labels into your workflow:
Grouping tasks based on urgency
As an example, you could add an @urgent tag to tasks that need to be done as soon as possible and a @soon tag for tasks that should be done ideally within the next few days or weeks.

You can then keep a Smart List for each of these labels and either schedule time to work on them in your calendar or prioritize them in your day or weekly planning.
Cleaning up an overflowing day plan
Using urgency type labels can also come in handy when your day plan has grown to astronomical proportions and is in need of a clean up.

Simply unscheduling all tasks can feel too scary as you don't want to loose track of those tasks. There is a reason you scheduled them into your day before, usually because they have some kind or urgency.

Adding some urgency labels and creating Smart Lists for those labels and then unscheduling the tasks creates a sort of "intermediate place" for them. They are not in your day list yet, but also not all the way back in the Master List with all the other tasks that aren't quite as urgent yet.

If you have a bad habit of over-scheduling your days keep these lists around and regularly send items there to keep your daily list as focused as possible. The smaller your day plan the more likely you are to get a lot of tasks done.

And after you finished all your tasks for today you can do some extra ones from the limbo lists.
5. Emotions


This is an interesting psychological hack that targets your emotions. The idea is that you tag tasks and projects with the positive emotions you will feel once the item is completed.

This helps to balance negative emotions we might associate with a task. The tag serves as a constant reminder of what we have to gain from completing this task.

Having to think about why we are doing a task in the first place is also great for building up motivation.
Integrating emotion tags into your workflow:
Keep a Smart List for each of those positive emotions, connect the lists to the custom sidebar and pick from the lists based on which emotion you currently desire.

You might also want to set up targets for yourself where you aim to complete one task each day that will make you feel "relief" for example.

# How many hours can you actually be productive in a day? | Amazing Marvin

> ## Excerpt
> In the 9-5 era, much is made of squeezing every last drop of productivity to get ahead in the world. But realistically, how many hours can a human actually be productive and get work done each day?

Is it realistic to work for eight hours a day, like many people are still paid to do? 

Well, let’s dig in and figure it out.

FYI, if you don't want to read through the entire thing and just cut to the chase, scroll down to read the key takeaway at the bottom.


Why this question matters - setting the right expectations
Understanding the human limits of productivity is really important in order to be happy and productive.

You probably have an idea in your head of how much work you expect to get done in a day - some standard you hold yourself to. It's important to realize that if that standard is unrealistic, you'll never truly feel accomplished at the end of the day. Even if you did get a lot done.

That’s demoralizing and highly destructive to your productivity in the long run.

I have seen many poor souls who beat themselves up for "only" time tracking 5 hours on their tasks, expecting to reach the standard 8 hours. They push themselves to do more each day until they burn out or subject themselves to such negative self-talk that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and they end up being truly unproductive due to complete lack of self-belief.

Setting the right expectations to begin with will help you to cultivate more positive emotions around your productivity like motivation and confidence, which are key emotions that will help you be productive.
What is considered productive work?
I consider housework, exercise, preparing healthy meals, and socializing to be "productive activities". But in this article, let's go with a bit narrower of a definition for what constitutes "work". 

Here is a list of typical examples of work activity:

 writing
 programming
 generating ideas
 solving problems
 filing & entering data
 planning
 designing
 illustrating
 studying

In summary, any task that requires a decent amount of mental focus, but very little physical effort is considered "work" for the sake of this article.

It's the type of work many of us now do for a living. Knowledge work or even what Cal Newport calls "Deep work". Highly focused task activity that requires us to really concentrate.

Of course, these activities can vary considerably in how much focus and mental effort they require, so they probably shouldn't all be lumped together - but, we’ll get back to that a bit later on.
How to track how much time you actually work
It's also important to note how to track productive hours so we’re talking about the same thing. There is a difference between hours that felt productive and hours that actually were productive.

Some people confuse working with sitting in front of a computer. But only a fraction of time spent sitting on our desk is spent actively working on a task. 

So when someone says they work 60 hours per week. What they really mean is: I spent 60 hours dedicated to working or I spent 60 hours in a work environment. 

But we are interested in how many of those hours are actually spent on real output-focused tasks? Therein lies an entirely different story.
Time tracking single tasks
A great way to track actual productive output time is to keep a to-do list where each task is between 5-60 minutes long and then track your time when you start the task and stop as soon as you finish the task.

For this to work, you need to break a task down until you have an action step that you can actually complete in one sitting. This is why your task should not be longer than 60m (most people need at least a quick break after 60 minutes).

You can track the time it takes to do each task with either a task manager that has integrated time tracking (like Amazing Marvin) or manually in a spreadsheet.

When you track time per-task and keep each task short you ensure you are only tracking time that is actually spent working.
Automatic time trackers
You can also use an automatic time tracker like RescueTime if most of your work happens on a computer and you can easily distinguish between productive sites/programs and unproductive ones.
Pomodoro technique
Some people also work with the pomodoro method and if you stick to it, you also get a pretty accurate reflection of how many hours of work you had.
How many productive hours do knowledge workers average in a day?
So let's dig into figuring out how many hours a human can be expected to be productive in a day. Let's start with some data on averages.
An interesting study
There is an interesting study that showed the average knowledge worker is only productive for about 3 hours every day.

Surprised?

It's no secret that many people browse Reddit, social media, or news sites at work. And we all know how you can get sucked into them and before you know it 30 minutes have passed.

Then there are breaks, talking to co-workers, and staring blankly at a screen pretending to work. So yeah, it doesn’t sound all that hard to use up 5 hours like that, does it?
Data from time tracking software RescueTime
As mentioned above RescueTime is software that allows you to automatically track which websites and apps you spend your time. Since you probably know in which apps actual work gets done, the app can help you figure out how much of your time is spent productively.

The app will give you a productivity pulse ranging from 0%-100% for each day.

RescueTime released a report for the year 2017 sharing the average productivity score of their users and to how many hours that translates to.

The startling result was an average productivity pulse of 53% for the year, which translated to 12.5 hours of productive time per week - that is 2.5 hours per day in a typical work week! 

This seems to align pretty well with the 3h per day from the workplace study above. Looks like we’re getting somewhere.
Why should these averages matter to you?
But how do these averages help you figure out what YOU should aim for? After all, since you’re reading this article you are probably interested in boosting your productivity and becoming the best you can be. So why would you care what the average worker does?

You’re right, it doesn't answer the main question. But it does give us some interesting insight into our natural productivity range. Plus, it might help you feel better about your current level of productivity. People who struggle with productivity often think everyone else works for hours every day with ease and that they are the abnormal ones. 

What I have found is that many people who consider themselves unproductive are actually quite productive but tend to have much higher standards than average.

But let's have a look at the upper ranges of productivity to help you set more realistic expectations for yourself.
What is the upper productivity range?
Analyzing tracked time from employees
One company that uses time tracking for their employees analyzed the data from their workers and saw that the most productive 10% of people worked 52 min for every 17 min break.

While I don't want want to get into whether there is anything magical about this break pattern, what we are interested in is that this pattern translates to a total of about 6 hours in an 8-hour workday for the most productive people. 
Planning estimates
Interestingly, in most project planning methodologies, you also use 6 hours per worker for calculating how long project will take. So there is that number 6 again. This means that even project planners know that practically nobody works 8 hours in an 8 hour day.

On a side note, now you also know why so many projects miss their deadlines since the average worker logs 3 hours per day, not 6… 😉

In more modern companies (often tech companies) managers usually account 4 hours per person per day when sprint planning. Maybe they have learnt over time that this is more accurate? Especially for highly focused work?
A note on mental effort
Keep in mind that both of these data sets come from people working in an office, so the type of work these people do can vary widely in how much mental effort they require, and the type of work and effort required plays a big role in how much we can achieve in a day. 

More on that below.
My personal experience
I track my time daily (with Amazing Marvin of course) and 6 hours of work time logged is a very productive day for me and indeed seems to be some kind of upper limit. I sometimes get up to 7-8 hours (depending on what I track that day and what kinds of tasks I am doing), but after a day like that I feel super exhausted and I usually can't replicate it the next day and will probably perform below my average or have to take a whole day off.

Generally, I try to aim for 4-6 productive hours per day. This might not sound like a very large number, but you will be amazed at how much you can get done in 5 hours of truly focused and well-prioritized work. Trust me!

One thing to note is that I do a variety of activities every day - some more exhausting than others. There is planning, programming, writing blog posts, designing websites, customer support, research, generating ideas etc.

For the high output work like programming and difficult writing 3-4 hours is a great day. And 2 hours is still a very productive day.
What about other people?
Of course, I am just one specimen, and who knows where I lie on the productivity spectrum. So, I asked around and read lots of discussions in forums trying to nail down what others are saying about how many hours they can work each day.
Amazing Marvin users
I polled our Amazing Marvin users who use time tracking and many say 3-4 is what they aim for in a day. 6-7 hours is a super productive day for most of them and not easy to do consistently. We hope to be able to collect more time tracking data in the future to come up with more fleshed out numbers.
Entrepreneurs
There was a lot of discussion  about how many hours of work you can get done on Hacker News too (here, here and here). Hacker News is a community with a lot of programmers and entrepreneurs so the type of work is comparable to the type of work we’re looking at.

Interestingly,  the number 6 came up again and again as an upper limit. Many people report that 6 hours of solid work a day seems to be the max for them. And after those 6 hours, they feel very mentally drained and completely done with work.
Programmers
Another interesting thing that popped up is that programmers specifically seem to agree that for pure programming 4 hours seems to be the upper limit per day.
Writers
There was a similar discussion of how many hours a day you can spend writing in a writing forum. and for writers, it turns out the sweet spot seems to be around 2-3 hours of actual writing.

This brings us to the important point that came up a few times before: The max hours you can work a day is highly dependent on how much mental energy your tasks require.
Henri Poincaré (Mathematician)
Henri Poincaré was a French Mathematician. He regularly worked from 10-12 and then from 5-7. So a total of 4 hours. He noticed that working longer never really lead to any more work getting done. His work was definitely highly mentally draining.
Cal Newport and readers
Cal Newport did some time tracking experiments and posted about it on his blog in 2012. Many people in the comments reported their experience with how many hours of work they can consistently get done. It ranges from 2-4 hours per day.
The variance in task energy requirements
How mentally draining each task is is difficult to categorize. And it is highly individual.

Even one activity like programming can vary in terms of mental effort required . Doing some simple implementation is vastly different than coming up with a new complex architecture. Or, even just programming in a language you are more familiar with will require less mental resources and enable you to program longer.

It's similar with writing. There is blog post writing and book writing. Then there are topics that just flow out of us and others that we really struggle with. And how much experience we have with writing is also a factor. Experienced writers can write for more productive hours in a day than beginners.

As a general rule, the more brain power (focus, creativity, lots of thinking) the work requires, the fewer hours you can expect to work each day.
The limiting factor of productivity
Another important takeaway from this is that for most of us our limiting factor for productivity is mental energy, not time.

When we subtract sleep, eating, hygiene, commute, and other commitments, there are often not as many hours left in the day as we think. Yet this number is usually still higher than what we are capable of doing when it comes to our mental energy.

We simply don't have an unlimited amount of focus in us.

So ultimately the number of hours you can work each day depends on the mental effort required for your tasks that day. Some days you might log more time because you spent time on less draining tasks. 

Your physical health also plays a huge factor in how many hours you can work. Simply being dehydrated can make focusing or starting a task such a struggle that we log much fewer hours. Not to mention days where we have high anxiety or feel down. 

It really all comes down to how much mental energy you have available each day and how much mental energy your tasks require.
Should you aim for the maximum each day?
No. What is more important is that we find a number that we can consistently hit. This is our personal sweet spot.

Personal sweet spots vary from person to person because we all have different types of work and different amounts of mental energy available or tasks.

It is entirely possible that you will have days where even with your regular sorts of tasks you will shoot above your sweet spot, perhaps even hitting 9-10 hours of productive work in a day. But that usually comes at the cost of productivity debt.
Concept of productivity debt.
Just like there is sleep debt there is also productivity debt. We can accumulate this debt over time as we work past our sweet spot. When this debt becomes big enough we eventually burn out and need a lot of off time to recover.

Key takeaway: If we work above what is actually our sweet spot, we accumulate debt. Sometimes the effects are immediately there like this guy describes:

" I can do 12 with a lunch break; however, I will be a zombie next day and half-zombie the day after.


If necessary, I can push this to 7-8 hours a day sustained for about 4 days, but then I need days to recharge afterwards before I really get anything done again."


But sometimes it's less obvious. If you're doing 6 hours a day, when actually you could only sustain 4.5 hours, you might be able to continue for 2-3 weeks and then BANG hit total unproductiveness for weeks while you recover.

Also, if you work weekends, you need even shorter work days to be able to sustain productivity long-term.

So, it's better to set daily goals that are focused on your sweet spot and not the maximum. The sweet spot is the number of hours you can work every day without accumulating productivity debt.

And don't worry if you ever log below your sweet spot range. You might have worked on more draining tasks that day (tasks we dread also take more mental energy, even if they are "simple") or your brain was simply not at your regular capacity. Make sure to take extra care of your brain if you feel like you are getting drained more easily than usual.
Finding your personal sweet spot and maximum
So how do you find your personal sweet spot?

The only way to know is to get tracking.

Seriously, if you want to set better time goals or are curious about how much you can work per day right now, get yourself a time tracking app or software like RescueTime.

Track your time for a few weeks and reflect each day on how you feel at the end of the day. Look for a trend. How many hours can you seem to hit consistently without feeling overly exhausted?

If you are hitting low numbers, no worries -- you can always work on improving your productivity. But you need to know where you are starting so you can track improvements and see what strategies are working for you.

Or perhaps you are just doing very strenuous work. Make sure to factor that in. If you are new at something it will always feel harder and you will be able to do it for less time before feeling exhausted.
An important point - productivity is not just about time logged
Ultimately, time is a helpful guide to track our productivity and vital to help us plan well, but it is not the be-all and end-all for productivity. More hours worked does not always mean we were more productive.

Productivity encompasses other concepts such as effectiveness and efficiency too.
But, I know this guy who works 100 hour weeks...
It is possible that there are a few people who do manage to log 8-10 productive hours daily for long periods of times. But they are much rarer than you think.

Most often when you  dig deeper you will find that one of the following points applies:

People define and track work differently. My bet is that people who claim to work 100 hour weeks do not actually track their time at all. So to them time spent working means how much time they allocated for work or sat in front of a computer trying to work, etc.

But there is a lot of inefficiencies like that. Even when I am super focused and I track my time with the task tracking method, there are usually 10-15 min that get lost on average per hour. Maybe bathroom breaks, getting water, thinking about something, small interruptions -- it all adds up.

Checking email and answering and having a semi-casual phone call, business lunches. There are tons of activities that technically can be counted as work, but aren't perhaps all that productive or strenuous in the end.

Also, people lie sometimes. To others and themselves.

Ultimately, it's not helpful to compare yourself to others. Everyone has a very different work situation and current level of ability.

Focus on finding your sweet spot and trying to hit that consistently. And don't sweat it when you don't. Remember productivity is more than hours logged and your current productivity level does not have to stay this way forever.
TLDR: How many hours a day should I aim for per day?
If you track your time and are setting time goals for yourself, I recommend sticking to the 5-6 hours max per day rule for a mix of regular task activities. If you can consistently hit that number via actual time tracked on tasks, you are among the most productive in the world.

Any work that produces a lot of output and requires a lot of focus and/or creativity (think writing, programming etc.) are high mental energy tasks. For those types of tasks, a good upper limit seems to be 3-4 hours a day. And working 2-3 hours on those tasks per day means you had a very productive day.

The key concept to remember that mental energy is the limiting factor here. And the more mental effort your work requires, the fewer hours you can work each day. 

Each person has a sweet spot of hours that they can work each day without getting burnt out over time. It's important to figure out what your current sweet spot is and trying to hit that consistently.

Curious how much work you get done? Try time tracking for a while (you can use the Amazing Marvin 30 day trial).

It is entirely possible that you will have days where even with your regular sorts of tasks you will shoot above your sweet spot, perhaps even hitting 9-10 hours of productive work in a day. But that usually comes at the cost of productivity debt.

## Concept of productivity debt.

Just like there is sleep debt there is also productivity debt. We can accumulate this debt over time as we work past our sweet spot. When this debt becomes big enough we eventually burn out and need a lot of off time to recover.

Key takeaway: **If we work above what is actually our sweet spot, we accumulate debt**. Sometimes the effects are immediately there like this guy describes:

_” I can do 12 with a lunch break; however, I will be a zombie next day and half-zombie the day after._

But sometimes it’s less obvious. If you’re doing 6 hours a day, when actually you could only sustain 4.5 hours, you might be able to continue for 2-3 weeks and then BANG hit total unproductiveness for weeks while you recover.

Also, if you work weekends, you need even shorter work days to be able to sustain productivity long-term.

**So, it’s better to set daily goals that are focused on your sweet spot and not the maximum**. The sweet spot is the number of hours you can work every day without accumulating productivity debt.

And don’t worry if you ever log below your sweet spot range. You might have worked on more draining tasks that day (tasks we dread also take more mental energy, even if they are “simple”) or your brain was simply not at your regular capacity. Make sure to take extra care of your brain if you feel like you are getting drained more easily than usual.

## Finding your personal sweet spot and maximum

So how do you find your personal sweet spot?

The only way to know is to get tracking.

Seriously, if you want to set better time goals or are curious about how much you can work per day right now, get yourself a [time tracking app](http://www.amazingmarvin.com/) or software like RescueTime.

**Track your time for a few weeks and reflect each day on how you feel at the end of the day**. Look for a trend. How many hours can you seem to hit consistently without feeling overly exhausted?

If you are hitting low numbers, no worries — you can always work on improving your productivity. But you need to know where you are starting so you can track improvements and see what strategies are working for you.

Or perhaps you are just doing very strenuous work. Make sure to factor that in. If you are new at something it will always feel harder and you will be able to do it for less time before feeling exhausted.

## An important point – productivity is not just about time logged

Ultimately, time is a helpful guide to track our productivity and vital to help us plan well, but it is not the be-all and end-all for productivity. **More hours worked does not always mean we were more productive**.

Productivity encompasses other concepts such as effectiveness and efficiency too.

### But, I know this guy who works 100 hour weeks…

It is possible that there are a few people who do manage to log 8-10 productive hours daily for long periods of times. But they are much rarer than you think.

Most often when you  dig deeper you will find that one of the following points applies:

People define and track work differently. My bet is that people who claim to work 100 hour weeks do not actually track their time at all. So to them time spent working means how much time they allocated for work or sat in front of a computer trying to work, etc.

But there is a lot of inefficiencies like that. Even when I am super focused and I track my time with the task tracking method, there are usually 10-15 min that get lost on average per hour. Maybe bathroom breaks, getting water, thinking about something, small interruptions — it all adds up.

Checking email and answering and having a semi-casual phone call, business lunches. There are tons of activities that technically can be counted as work, but aren’t perhaps all that productive or strenuous in the end.

Also, people lie sometimes. To others and themselves.

Ultimately, it’s not helpful to compare yourself to others. Everyone has a very different work situation and current level of ability.

Focus on finding your sweet spot and trying to hit that consistently. And don’t sweat it when you don’t. Remember productivity is more than hours logged and your current productivity level does not have to stay this way forever.

## TLDR: How many hours a day should I aim for per day?

If you [track your time](https://help.amazingmarvin.com/strategies/time-management/time-tracking) and are setting time goals for yourself, I recommend sticking to the 5-6 hours max per day rule for a mix of regular task activities. If you can consistently hit that number via actual time tracked on tasks, you are among the most productive in the world.

Any work that produces a lot of output and requires a lot of focus and/or creativity (think writing, programming etc.) are high mental energy tasks. For those types of tasks, a good upper limit seems to be 3-4 hours a day. And working 2-3 hours on those tasks per day means you had a very productive day.

The key concept to remember that mental energy is the limiting factor here. **And the more mental effort your work requires, the fewer hours you can work each day.**

Each person has a sweet spot of hours that they can work each day without getting burnt out over time. It’s important to figure out what your current sweet spot is and trying to hit that consistently.

Curious how much work you get done? Try time tracking for a while (you can use the [Amazing Marvin](http://www.amazingmarvin.com/) 30 day trial).

# 5 Benefits of using Time Estimates in your To-do List | Amazing Marvin

> ## Excerpt
> When it comes to productivity, different things work for different people.

But there are some productivity hacks that work for most people. Using task duration estimates aka time estimates is one of them.


What are time estimates?
The idea is simple:

Whenever you create a task you also include how long you think it will take you to complete the task.



Whenever I introduce this strategy to a client they get super excited to try it out. And later they come back raving about how much it's helped them with their work.

Sadly, few people actually use time estimates because they either don't know about it or don't use an application that supports this feature (almost none of the popular to-do list apps do 👎).

But in this post I show you 5 surprising ways time estimates can boost your productivity and help fight procrastination. At the end I also included some ideas on how you can implement this strategy into your workflow right now.
1) Time estimates make a long to-do list less intimidating
less to-do list overwhelm, less procrastination
Imagine you look at your to-do list for the day and thirty tasks are staring back at you: instant overwhelm and dread.

The longer your to-do list, the more you want to avoid it.

But long lists can be deceiving. If you have a bunch of quick phone calls to make and a ton of little mini tasks that you collected over the week, then your to-do list can quickly become a mile long without actually requiring very much time to complete.

Without time estimates all we see is a seemingly endless list. But once you attach a time estimate to each task and look at the total,  your perception of the list can instantly change:




2) Time estimates help you get started sooner
overcome the "I can do this later today" fallacy
Many people have a warped sense of time. For example, I used to believe that time magically expands the later it gets in the day.

Somehow the time left in the day seemed almost infinite. This led me to have absolutely no sense of urgency when it came to my tasks for the day. As long as it was not dinnertime yet I felt there was still plenty of time left to get through all my tasks somehow. Ha!

Had I actually gotten any work done in the morning I would have realized how quickly an hour goes by! And obviously an hour in the morning is just as long as an hour in the evening.

Time estimates give you the facts. A time estimate for your entire to-do list lets you see how much time you need to get through all your tasks (assuming you have already honed your estimation skills) in black and white. And your watch will tell you how much time there is left in the day to work... you can do the math.

Most often seeing the total time of your to-do list will give you a little kick in the butt to get started sooner rather than later.

The same principle also applies to projects. Understanding how many hours it takes to complete an entire project will help you get started sooner.
3) Time estimates can make a difficult task less intimidating
the less intimidating a task, the more likely you will do it
Without a time estimate we only see what the task entails. So our focus is on the activity we have to do. If a task is unpleasant in any way or particularly difficult we will have a natural aversion towards the task and tend to avoid it (hello procrastination!).

But when you add a time estimate to a task, you now have something else you can focus on: how quickly this unpleasantness will be over. To most people even 15 or 25 minutes seems like a short period of time. This fact works to your advantage when you add time estimates to your tasks.



This has worked particularly well for me when it comes to an activity I dread immensely: making phone calls! I would often not cut my hair until I looked like a jungle creature just because I dreaded making appointments over the phone.

After using time estimates daily I am now used to looking at the number beneath the task to assess its "difficulty". So when I have a phone call on my list now, I immediately see the "1min" and it becomes one of the "easy" tasks on my list. Tricked you, brain!

Obviously, this can backfire if you make tasks that take a long time (which is not a good idea for many reasons). So if you want to take advantage of this, then it's extra important to keep your to-dos short and snappy (especially tasks that you are dreading). Any big task can be split up into smaller tasks. It just takes a bit of practice and know-how.
4) Time estimates help you become a better time estimator
level up your project planning skills
If you use time estimates in combination with time tracking (measuring how long it takes you to actually do the task) you will notice patterns about which tasks you commonly underestimate and which tasks are actually much quicker than you think.

Raising awareness about this discrepancy in task duration will make you better at estimating task length in the future. And knowing how long individual tasks take is an important part of being able to estimate how long entire projects take.

This is obviously a super important skill for many people:

 For freelancers who juggle multiple projects and need to give clients accurate project completion estimates and plan their time
 For students who want to get started on an assignment at the right time to avoid a panicked all-nighter
 For entrepreneurs who need to plan out a roadmap with many projects to grow their business
 For office workers who want to ensure they can complete a project on time and set realistic deadlines in the first place

5) Time estimates prevent you from putting too much on your plate
actually finish your daily to-do list and feel amazing
How often do you actually manage to complete your entire to-do list for the day? If you are like most people the answer is: rarely.

The problem is that it is often not even possible to complete everything we put on our lists. After all, there are only so many hours in the day. Plus we don't have all those hours available for work and we also don't have unlimited focus and energy.

Not finishing your to-do list feels super unsatisfying and can even spiral you into negative self-talk about how you are unproductive, lazy, and a total loser. Studies have shown that this negative self-talk leads us to be even less productive the next day. So it's very important to try and avoid this.

But actually finishing your to-do list feels amazing. ✨

We need to set ourselves up for to-do list success so we can feel good about ourselves and the work we do. This will increase your self-confidence and belief in yourself, which in turn will help you get even more done. It's a positive feedback loop.

Time estimates help you to create a more realistic to-do list that you can actually finish in a day. The key is to know how much time of active work you can realistically get done in any given day. Then you can make sure the total time estimate doesn't exceed that limit.


How you can incorporate time estimates in your workflow
If you are a pen and paper kind of person you can just write a time estimate next to each task and manually total them up as you add more tasks.

If you are a Marvin user you can turn on the strategy called "How long will this take?" and start adding time estimates to each task by adding a "~" followed by the time estimate. It will automatically add up the estimate within each section and display the total at the top.



If you use another app to manage your tasks you can add a time estimate at the end or beginning of each task title. Unfortunately, most to-do list apps do not support an automatic totaling of the time. But you can always do it manually.

Summary
Time estimates can boost your productivity and help you fight procrastination. Try using them in your workflow to see if they work for you.
Time estimates can help you...

 procrastinate less because your long list of tasks looks way more doable when you focus on the total time it takes to complete it
 get started sooner on your work for the day because you know exactly how much time you need to get it done and how much time there is left in the day
 not put off a difficult task because even a dreadful task feels doable if you focus on how quickly it can be over
 improve your project planning skills by becoming more aware of how accurate your estimates are (when used in combination with time tracking)
 finish your entire to-do list for the day because you won't put too much on there in the first place

# Workflow: Daily priorities Matrix | Amazing Marvin

> ## Excerpt
> The idea with this workflow is to have your daily task list split up into four lists based on priority and then work off one list after the other.

The four lists will be displayed as a Matrix like so:

On the top left you have the tasks you absolutely must do today. Once those are finished you move on to the list next to it and once you tackled those you move on to the next quadrant...
Is this workflow right for you?
This workflow could work well for you if you feel overwhelmed by the long list of tasks in your day.

Splitting up a long list into 4 smaller lists not only makes them feel more manageable (short lists tend to get done more often!) but it also creates nice milestones to hit that boost your motivation along the way.

Visually, the concise display of the Matrix (squares + numbers!) makes a long list feel much less overwhelming too.
Use daily or to work off a backlogged daily list
You can use this workflow idea either on a more permanent basis along with a day planning approach or strategically at times when your daily list has gotten too long and you need a fun way to get back to a clean slate.
How to set up this workflow
Strategies to turn on
In order to set up this workflow you need to have the following strategies turned on:

 Matrix
 Priority Stars
 Smart Lists

Set up your Smart Lists
The first step is to set up the four Smart Lists we need:

 Scheduled today & red priority star
 Scheduled today & orange priority star
 Scheduled today & yellow priority star
 Scheduled today & no priority star

Don't worry about what to call them, just make sure you can easily identify them based on the name. Something like: "today red star" is sufficient.

To set up the filters you use the "Scheduled" and "Priority" filter as shown in the images below.



 


Set up your Matrix
Once you set up your Smart Lists you can go to the Matrix strategy settings and

 connect each quadrant with the correct Smart list
 give the quadrant a fitting name
 pick a color for each quadrant

That is it! You are all set. Read below on how to use the workflow.
How to use this workflow
Every day you create your daily list as usual.

So, if you are used to scheduling tasks from the Master List into your day, do that.

Once you have your to-do list for today go to step 1.
Step 1. Assign stars to your tasks.
Go through your list and decide how important each task is.

The most important tasks (must do today) get a red star. The tasks with the next level of importance get an orange star. Somewhat important tasks get a yellow star and bonus tasks don't get any star.
Everything is important
This step sounds simple in theory but many people struggle with the idea of assigning a rating of importance to their tasks. Isn't everything "important"? Or why else would it be on your list, right?

If you are struggling to assign stars it can be helpful to take some time to more clearly define what "important" means to you.

Perhaps you want to factor in urgency or how much something is weighing on you (get those out of the way ASAP) or perhaps you want to define importance based on how closely it is tied to your main goal at the moment.

Also read tip #1 if you have a hard time assigning stars.

But ultimately, if you find yourself struggling too much with this step, maybe this workflow is just not for you! :)


Step 2. Work off your tasks
Once you have prioritized your tasks you can now scroll up and focus on the Matrix.

The key idea with this workflow is to work off one quadrant at a time and only move to the next one when the previous one is completed.

You start with the most important tasks and only when those are finished do you move on to the list with the next level of priority.
How to pick tasks
It is up to you how you pick which tasks to work on first within the quadrant. You can always work on the one Marvin thinks you should do next by clicking the "suggested" button. Or just get one at random with the "random" button.
Workflow tips
Tip 1 - Limit star number
It can be helpful to stick to a fixed number of stars you are assigning for each level. Especially for the high priority levels.

This not only makes it easier to assign the stars but you are also more likely to get to the 3rd or 4th quadrant which will feel really satisfying.

So for example, each day aim to give out only 2 red stars and 3 orange stars.
Tip 2 - Use the auto-pick buttons
In the Matrix settings you can specify what happens when you click a quadrant. It can either give you a task at random, give you the task Marvin thinks you should do next (based on a secret algorithm, show you the entire list so you can pick a task or just give you the task at the top of the list (use this in combination with a sort order in the Smart List).
Tip 3 - Assign frogs
If you use the frog strategy this is also a good time to think about which tasks you dread and assign them a frog. Marvin takes your dread level into consideration when suggesting a task to you. ;)
Tip 4 - Assign time/duration estimates
Any day planning workflow benefits from time estimates. Putting too much on our plate for a day is one of the most common problems. It leads us to always feel disappointed with what we got done today, because it is never EVERYTHING we wanted to.

Assigning time estimates to tasks makes us realize before we get frustrated with ourselves that our day is just way too packed.

And check out all these other benefits of using duration estimates in your tasks.

-   Scheduled today & no priority star

Don’t worry about what to call them, just make sure you can easily identify them based on the name. Something like: “today red star” is sufficient.

To set up the filters you use the “Scheduled” and “Priority” filter as shown in the images below.

Set the scheduled filter for “today”

![Pick the correct priority star and "no star" for each one of your lists](Workflow%20Daily%20priorities%20Matrix%20%20Amazing%20Marvin/img_5ba8ecdf29207.png)

## Set up your Matrix

Once you set up your Smart Lists you can go to the [Matrix strategy settings](https://help.amazingmarvin.com/strategies/customization/matrix) and

-   connect each quadrant with the correct Smart list
-   give the quadrant a fitting name
-   pick a color for each quadrant

That is it! You are all set. Read below on how to use the workflow.

## How to use this workflow

Every day you create your daily list as usual.

So, if you are used to scheduling tasks from the Master List into your day, do that.

Once you have your to-do list for today go to step 1.

## Step 1. Assign stars to your tasks.

Go through your list and decide how important each task is.

The most important tasks (must do today) get a red star. The tasks with the next level of importance get an orange star. Somewhat important tasks get a yellow star and bonus tasks don’t get any star.

#### Everything is important

This step sounds simple in theory but many people struggle with the idea of assigning a rating of importance to their tasks. Isn’t everything “important”? Or why else would it be on your list, right?

If you are struggling to assign stars it can be helpful to take some time to more clearly define what “important” means to you.

Perhaps you want to factor in urgency or how much something is weighing on you (get those out of the way ASAP) or perhaps you want to define importance based on how closely it is tied to your main goal at the moment.

Also read tip #1 if you have a hard time assigning stars.

But ultimately, if you find yourself struggling too much with this step, maybe this workflow is just not for you! 🙂

![](Workflow%20Daily%20priorities%20Matrix%20%20Amazing%20Marvin/img_5ba9ee2adde82.png)

## Step 2. Work off your tasks

Once you have prioritized your tasks you can now scroll up and focus on the Matrix.

The key idea with this workflow is to **work off one quadrant at a time and only move to the next one when the previous one is completed**.

You start with the most important tasks and only when those are finished do you move on to the list with the next level of priority.

#### How to pick tasks

It is up to you how you pick which tasks to work on first within the quadrant. You can always work on the one Marvin thinks you should do next by clicking the “suggested” button. Or just get one at random with the “random” button.

## Workflow tips

## Tip 1 – Limit star number

It can be helpful to stick to a fixed number of stars you are assigning for each level. Especially for the high priority levels.

This not only makes it easier to assign the stars but you are also more likely to get to the 3rd or 4th quadrant which will feel really satisfying.

So for example, each day aim to give out only 2 red stars and 3 orange stars.

## Tip 2 – Use the auto-pick buttons

In the Matrix settings you can specify what happens when you click a quadrant. It can either give you a task at random, give you the task Marvin thinks you should do next (based on a secret algorithm, show you the entire list so you can pick a task or just give you the task at the top of the list (use this in combination with a [sort order in the Smart List](https://help.amazingmarvin.com/how-to-questions-and-answers/how-to-sort-your-smart-lists)).

## Tip 3 – Assign frogs

If you use the frog strategy this is also a good time to think about which tasks you dread and assign them a frog. Marvin takes your dread level into consideration when suggesting a task to you. 😉

## Tip 4 – Assign time/duration estimates

Any day planning workflow benefits from time estimates. Putting too much on our plate for a day is one of the most common problems. It leads us to always feel disappointed with what we got done today, because it is never EVERYTHING we wanted to.

Assigning time estimates to tasks makes us realize before we get frustrated with ourselves that our day is just way too packed.

And check out all these other [benefits of using duration estimates in your tasks](https://blog.amazingmarvin.com/5-benefits-of-using-time-estimates-in-your-to-do-list/).

# The two types of to-do lists and why you need both | Amazing Marvin

> ## Excerpt
> It would be difficult to find an adult on this planet that has never written a to-do list.

The to-do list is often the first attempt of gaining some control over your life when you feel like you are drowning in responsibility.

But to-do lists come in many forms. And understanding the different types of to-do lists is crucial so you can use them effectively.

In this post I will explain the difference between an endless and a finite to-do list and why you want to use both types in your life to reap maximum benefits.


The two main types of to-do lists
The endless to-do list
If you simply write down everything you need to do, you are creating an endless todo list.

An endless to-do list is one that is never complete. The list grows and shrinks as tasks come in and get completed.

A list that contains everything you have to do is often called a Master List. And since in life there is always something left for you to do (even on the day you die) the Master List is by default an endless list.

Endless lists are a fact of life and necessary to unburden your brain from having to remember things. Because the only alternative is to not write your to-dos down at all and keep them in your head, which really isn't a good idea.



But the idea with an endless list isn't to complete the entire list and be done with it. 

And while this makes sense when you think about it, that is often precisely what we are trying to do subconsciously.

Get all the counts to 0.

But for the majority of people it is impossible to ever get their Master List count to 0, even for a minute.

This is because we have an inborn drive for completion and closure.

But this inherent conflict of striving to get our to-do list completed when that is just not possible is a huge cause of stress and frustration.

In fact I call it a special form of torture.... and how many of us expose ourselves to this torture day after day?

So instead of torturing ourselves let's use that striving for completion to our advantage by creating finite lists and working on those.
The finite todo list
A finite list is a list that you can complete. It is finite. 

There comes a point where everything  in a finite list is completed and you can move on from that list.
The daily to-do list
One of the most popular finite list is the daily todo list. It only lists what you intend to do today. The goal is to finish the entire list within a given day after which the list is "done".


Project lists
Another type of finite list is a project list. A project should have a clearly defined end goal. Once that end goal is met, the project is complete. The project list holds all the tasks that you need to get done in order to complete the project.

Finite lists help us actually do things because they are using our internal drive for completion to motivate us. They also tend to be shorter than endless lists which makes it easier for you to get started on it as you are not crushed by overwhelm just looking at them.


Why you need both types of to-do lists
Both types of lists serve a different purpose.
Why you need an endless Master List
The first purpose of an endless to-do list is to get things out of your head, Plain and simple.

Trying to keep your to-do list only in our head creates a ton of stress and leads to lots of things falling through the cracks.

So the first purpose of the endless list is to act as external storage for your tasks.

The other reason why you want to keep an endless list of all your tasks is that it helps you have a better overview over what you have to do. This is necessary to effectively  prioritize your tasks.

Prioritizing is VERY difficult to do in your head the moment you have more than 3 things to do.

Seeing all your tasks in one list allows you to sort, group and move them around so you can get a better idea of what is important right now to do.

So writing all your tasks down somewhere in one central place is key.

The drawbacks with an endless lists is that:

 they are not very motivating to work from as they can't be completed
 they are often very long and overwhelming, creating a large deterrent to getting started

This is why most productivity coaches will encourage you to not work directly from your Master list.
The dread of working from an endless list


You don't want to be constantly confronted with ALL the work we have to do when you try to get work done. That will make you feel instantly overwhelmed. And feeling overwhelmed often triggers procrastination.

If you ever wondered why you set up all your tasks in a task management system but then never go check it or work on it, a big part of the reason is because it's unpleasant to see your entire workload, so you avoid it altogether.

Even if you manage to go and face our massive to-do list and not give in to the dreadful sense of overwhelm, you will likely have too many choices and won't know where to start.

And once you do get started and check off tasks you will quickly start to feel unmotivated when the endlessness of it all starts to sink in. As one task leaves the list another one swoops in.

You just never get the satisfaction of completing something. Which can feel like you are not making progress at all.
The benefit of working from a finite list


Humans have an inborn drive to complete things. And you can use this to your advantage when creating finite lists to work off of.

Imagine you have a todo list with 8 items in front of you. You get started and complete 3. Seeing the task count go from 8 to 5 feels great.  You almost completed half the list already!

You will feel motivated to complete the last 5 tasks to complete the entire list. The feeling of completing an entire list and being done with it feels amazing.

The same goes for a project. Not only do you get a little dopamine rush every time you check off a task, but once an entire project is completed or even just a milestone you feel a major sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.

Working towards a clearly defined end goal will help you keep going when things get tough. Only finite lists have clearly defined ends.

This drive to completion is so powerful that there are many productivity techniques that take advantage of this principle to boost motivation:

 project milestones
 sprints
 quarterly targets
 grouping a finite list into smaller sections

The motivation can be increased even further with visualizations that clearly show you how close you are to completing a list.


Conclusion
Both types of lists - endless and finite - have a clear purpose and are important. Ideally you have an endless list that serves as your first touch point for capture and prioritization and then make finite lists by grouping things into projects, creating time-limited finite lists (monthly, weekly or daily lists) and/or break your huge list into smaller finite lists that serve as milestones.

The point is to try and work off of finite lists as much as possible to keep motivation high. When there is an end in sight you are much more likely to keep pushing when things get tough.

Extra tip: To make an end extra enticing, set up a reward for yourself for each finite list you complete.

# 8 Steps to Break Down Tasks Into Manageable Pieces · Blog · ActiveCollab

> ## Excerpt
> Follow our precise step-by-step guide to effectively breakdown tasks, boosting your productivity and facilitating the process of achieving your goals.

---
In the complex world of project management, juggling various tasks and ensuring they are completed on time is paramount. However, these tasks can often be large, multifaceted, and intimidating. That's where the art of breaking down tasks comes into play.

Breaking down tasks, or task decomposition or chunking tasks, is a project management technique that involves dividing a large task or project into smaller, more manageable parts.

In this post, we will explore the importance of task decomposition in project management, demonstrating how it can improve efficiency, reduce stress, and ultimately lead to the successful completion of your project.

Whether you're a seasoned project manager looking for new strategies or a novice seeking basic principles, this post will equip you with valuable insights. So, let's start turning those complex tasks into manageable pieces.

## Step-By-Step Instructions for Breaking Down Tasks

-   **Understand the Task:** Before breaking down a task, you must thoroughly understand it. What is the end goal? What are the requirements? This step involves reviewing all the information about the task or project and clarifying any uncertainties.
-   **Break It Down:** Once you understand the task, divide it into smaller, manageable parts. Each part should be a self-contained unit that contributes to the overall goal.
-   **Sequence the Tasks:** After breaking down the task, determine how these smaller tasks should be completed. Some tasks will naturally precede others, while some can be done concurrently.
-   **Estimate Time:** For each small task, estimate how long it will take to complete. This will help in planning and scheduling.
-   **Prioritize:** Not all tasks are created equal. Some are more critical to the project's success than others. [Prioritize the tasks](https://activecollab.com/blog/collaboration/prioritizing-tasks) based on their importance, deadlines, and dependencies.
-   **Plan for Breaks:** Remember to schedule short breaks between tasks. This can help prevent burnout and maintain high productivity levels.
-   **Track Your Progress:** Keep track of your progress as you work through the tasks. This will give you a sense of accomplishment and help you identify delays or problems early on.
-   **Review and Adjust:** Finally, regularly review your task list and progress. Adjust your plan based on priority changes, unexpected obstacles, or tasks taking longer than expected. Remember, the plan is dynamic and should serve your needs.

![](8%20Steps%20to%20Break%20Down%20Tasks%20Into%20Manageable%20Pieces%20%C2%B7%20Blog%20%C2%B7%20ActiveCollab/8-steps-to-break-down-tasks-into-manageable-pieces---intext.png)  

### Understand the Task

The first step towards breaking down a task is to understand it fully. This involves several factors:

-   **Type of Task:** What kind of task is it? Is it a research project, a report, a design job, or something else? Each type of task requires a different approach and skill set.
-   **Size of Task:** How big is the task? A larger task will require more time and resources and should be broken down into smaller tasks.
-   **Deadline:** When does the task need to be completed? Understanding the deadline will help you prioritize and schedule your work effectively.
-   **[Dependencies](https://activecollab.com/blog/project-management/task-dependencies-for-better-project-management):** Do any other tasks need to be completed before this one? Some tasks depend on others, and understanding these dependencies will help you sequence your assignments correctly.

### Task Splitting

Once you fully understand the task, it's time to break it into smaller subtasks. This process is often referred to as task splitting.

-   **Identify the 'Parent Task':** The parent task is the main task or project that you're trying to complete. It's the overarching goal that you're working towards.
-   **Break Down the Parent Task:** Start dividing the parent task into smaller, bite-sized tasks. Each of these parts should be a self-contained unit that contributes to completing the parent task.

For example, if your parent's task is to write a report, some subtasks might include conducting research, drafting each section, editing, and proofreading. Each one of these subtasks is a step towards completing the overall parent task.

### Organize Tasks

After breaking down your parent task into smaller subtasks, the next step is organizing these tasks logically to ensure that everything gets done in the right sequence.

-   **Identify Dependencies:** Some tasks may depend on the completion of others. For example, in a report-writing project, you can only start writing once you've completed your research.
-   **Sequential Order:** Arrange your tasks in the order they need to be completed.
-   **Consider Task Importance:** If a particular task is critical for the progress of your project, it might need to be tackled earlier.

### Estimate Time on Task

Once you've broken down and sequenced your tasks, the next step is to estimate how long each task will take. This helps plan your schedule effectively and ensure the project stays on track.

-   **Past Experience:** Use your experience with similar tasks to guide your estimation.
-   **Task Complexity:** Consider the complexity of each task. More complex tasks will naturally take more time to complete.
-   **Available Resources:** The amount of time a task takes can also depend on your available resources. For example, tasks might take longer if you have fewer people to work on them or lack the necessary tools or information.

### Prioritize Tasks

After estimating the time for each task, the next step is to [prioritize](https://activecollab.com/blog/collaboration/prioritizing-tasks) them. This means identifying which tasks are most critical to the success of your project and should be tackled first.

-   **Identify Critical Tasks:** Some tasks are more important than others. These might be tasks that significantly impact the project, tasks that are on the critical path (i.e., tasks that, if delayed, would delay the whole project), or tasks with early deadlines. Identify these tasks and prioritize them.
-   **Consider Delegation:** When prioritizing tasks, consider whether any can be delegated. [Delegating tasks](https://activecollab.com/blog/collaboration/delegating-tasks) can free up time to focus on the most critical tasks. When deciding which tasks to delegate, consider your team members' skills and capacities and the task's complexity and importance.

### Plan for Breaks

Planning for breaks is a critical part of effective task management. Regular breaks can help prevent burnout, increase productivity, and maintain high levels of focus and creativity.

-   **Schedule Regular Breaks:** As you plan your tasks, schedule regular breaks in between. You can use the Pomodoro technique to schedule your breaks successfully.
-   **Use the [Workload Feature](https://activecollab.com/resources/workload-management) of ActiveCollab:** This project management tool provides a workload feature, letting you see how much work each team member has and whether anyone is overloaded. You can use this feature to ensure that work is distributed evenly and everyone has time for breaks.

### Track Progress

Keeping track of your progress is an essential part of task management. It helps you stay motivated, provides a sense of achievement, and allows you to adjust your plan if needed.

ActiveCollab is a project management tool that allows you to mark tasks as done once they are completed. Each time you finish a task, mark it off in the system.

Seeing your progress visually can be very motivating. ActiveCollab lets you view your tasks in a list, as a timeline (Gantt chart), or in a Kanban board, depending on your preference.

As you complete tasks and reach milestones in your project, take a moment to celebrate these achievements. This can provide a much-needed boost of motivation and positivity.

### Review and Adjust

No matter how well you plan, things sometimes go differently than expected. That's why it's important to review your progress and adjust your plan as needed regularly.

Set aside time each week (or each day, depending on the project) to review your progress. Look at your completed tasks, which are still pending, and whether you're on track to meet your deadlines.

If you're falling behind, try to identify why. Are there tasks that are taking longer than expected? Are there unexpected problems that have come up?

Based on your review, you might need to adjust your plan. This could mean re-prioritizing tasks, pushing back deadlines, or asking for additional resources. Feel free to change your plan if it's not working.

## Why is breaking down tasks important?

Task decomposition boosts productivity, aids in risk management, allows efficient resource allocation, and enables more accurate project planning. By facilitating better progress tracking, task chunking turns work into a more understandable, manageable, and achievable process. It provides clarity on what needs to be done.

## What is micro-productivity (micro-tasking)?

Microproductivity, or micro-tasking, is a productivity strategy that involves breaking down a large task or project into smaller, more manageable tasks. These smaller tasks are often quick to complete, allowing you to make progress even when you only have short periods available.

The concept behind micro-productivity is to leverage the small pockets of time we have throughout our day (known as "micro-moments") to achieve larger goals over time. This approach can help reduce overwhelming feelings associated with large tasks and improve motivation by providing frequent moments of accomplishment.

For example, instead of writing a report in one sitting, you might break it down into smaller tasks like researching a specific topic, writing an outline, writing one section at a time, and so on. Each task can be completed individually, allowing you to progress on the report even if you don't have time to sit down and write the whole thing at once.

## The Role of Team and Responsibilities in Task Breakdown

### Teamwork in Task Completion

Teamwork plays a crucial role in task completion. By working together, teams can leverage each other's strengths and compensate for each other's weaknesses. Teamwork encourages sharing ideas and knowledge, leading to innovative solutions and better decision-making.

### Assigning Roles and Responsibilities within the Team

A critical aspect of task breakdown is assigning roles and responsibilities within the team. Each team member should clearly understand their tasks and what is expected of them. The assignment of roles and responsibilities should consider each team member's skills, interests, and capabilities to ensure that they can perform their tasks effectively. This helps ensure that tasks are completed efficiently and promotes accountability and ownership among team members.

### Efficient Communication in Task Management

Communication is the backbone of effective [task management](https://activecollab.com/task-management). Clear, concise, and timely communication ensures that everyone understands their roles and responsibilities, keeps track of progress, addresses issues promptly, and stays aligned with the overall project goals.

## Overcoming Procrastination and Stress through Task Decomposition

Overcoming procrastination and stress can be a challenge, especially when faced with large, complex tasks. However, task decomposition - the process of breaking down large tasks into smaller, more manageable components - can be a powerful tool in mitigating these issues.

-   **Tackling Large Tasks:** Large tasks can often seem intimidating, leading to [procrastination](https://activecollab.com/blog/growth/procrastination-reasons-solutions), and team members try to avoid them. Composing these tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks makes them less daunting and easier to tackle. This act alone can reduce delay, promoting action and productivity.
-   **Reducing Stress:** Task decomposition also helps reduce stress. When faced with a large, complex task, figuring out where to start can be stressful. But, by breaking it down into smaller parts, you can focus on one thing at a time, reducing the cognitive load and associated stress.
-   **Creating a Clear Path Forward:** Each smaller task provides a clear next step, making starting and maintaining momentum easier. This clarity can help overcome the inertia often associated with procrastination.

# Three simple rules for writing great tasks for your to-do list | Amazing Marvin

> ## Excerpt
> How often do you actually finish a to-do list you created?

If you are like most people the answer is: rarely.

The problem is that most people write really crappy to-do lists. And when it comes to getting things done, a crappy list is often worse than having no list at all.

A great to-do list, on the other hand, will make it easier for you to get work done.


Master the art of writing good tasks
There are a few key things to get right if you want to write a great to-do list.

In this post I will go over one of those key things: how to write good tasks.

Tasks are the meat of every to-do list. And how you write a task has a big influence on how easy (or hard) it will be for you to complete the task once you encounter it on your to-do list. So writing great tasks is a vital skill for you to master on your road to becoming a to-do list slayer.
What makes a task great?
The goal is to create a tasty task. A tasty task is one that you immediately want to do when you look at it. This happens when it's super clear what the task entails and you feel confident that you can actually complete the task

A tasty task (not just because of the cake)
On the other hand, a badly written task puts you off doing it immediately because it triggers feelings of uncertainty and/or overwhelm. And it is only natural to want to avoid things that make us feel bad.

A vague and huge task, eww!



I rarely look at a task and want to do it immediately... what to do?
If you suffer from procrastination issues (and most of us do), then you can feel put off even from the most well written task. The task itself just causes too many negative feelings. Writing good tasks will definitely help to reduce the negative feelings somewhat, but you'll also have work on fixing the procrastination at its source. More on how to do that coming soon!


So, here are three basic rules to stick to in order to create tasty tasks:

1) Start with a Verb
action words
Every task should start with a verb. This makes it very easy for the brain to understand what “to do” and shift into action mode.
The more specific the verb, the better. Ideally you should immediately get some kind of mental image of you doing the task as soon as you look at the verb.

Verb-less tasks, what do I need to do!?
Sticking to this rule will also help you to keep most of your tasks single action steps and to not create tasks that really should be projects when they include a series of smaller steps.

Multi step tasks that really should be projects.
Here is a list of some great verbs to use in your tasks:


 Brainstorm

 Call
 Clean
 Code
 Decide
 Design
 Discuss

 Email
 Fill out

 Finish
 Organize
 Read
 Research
 Schedule
 Write

2) Keep them Short
bite-sized treats
A task should take you at most one hour to complete. The bigger a task is, the more intimidating it will look when it’s time to get it done. You really want a task to be bite-sized.
Especially difficult tasks or ones you are dreading benefit from being very short. You are much more likely to start on a task that will only take you 10min rather than 1 hour to complete.



Use time estimates in your to-do list to help you keep tasks small. Time estimates have a ton of additional benefits and can really boost your effectiveness.







But doesn't a task just take as long as it takes?
Any task can be broken down into smaller steps to make smaller tasks out of it. This will make a large task more manageable. Learning how to break down a large task is another important skill to master.


3) Make them Specific and Clear
no question marks allowed
A good task is so crystal clear that you immediately know where to start when looking at it. So make sure each task is specific and includes enough context that it’s still clear what to do even when you look at the task a few days after having created it.
When you look at a task there should be absolutely no confusion about what to do. No one likes the feeling of uncertainty. So avoid creating vague or unclear tasks, or else you will want to avoid them as soon as you see them.

Crystal clear tasks
Another part of being "clear" is that you should always know when a task is considered "completed". For tasks like sending an email or filling out an application, the end of the task is pretty obvious. But beware tasks that have no clear end.

You can always create an end to a task by adding a time limit (this is called time boxing a task). Check out the examples of good tasks below to see a few time boxed tasks.

If a task is on the complex side, it can help to add subtasks to it that outline the steps to take. For tasks that need a lot of context it's a good idea to attach a note to a task with more info inside. (Marvin supports both subtasks and notes)

# How to plan your days when each day is different and unpredictable | Amazing Marvin

> ## Excerpt
> You probably already know that planning your day is one of the most important productivity habits you can develop.

But you are unsure how a day plan could possibly work for you. No two days are the same in your life and you never know what's going to come up!

Perhaps you have even tried to plan out your day in advance. But it just left you frustrated when the plan fell apart within the first few hours. And trying to adhere to the plan made you feel super stressed.

I hear you!

But good news: Daily planning comes in many shapes and sizes. And I firmly believe that the perfect day plan is out there for everyone.  It's just a matter of finding the type of day plan that works for you.


A day plan does not have to be a day routine
First off, a common misconception about day plans is that they need to be the same or similar from one day to the next. Almost like a daily routine.

While there are certainly benefits to routines in general, they don't have to span your entire day. You can have a morning routine for example, and then have something different going on every day after that.

If your days are unpredictable and different, don't fixate on trying to create a daily routine. It's OK to have each day be unique. And we can still make an awesome day plan for each one.
The golden rules for day planning
one day at a time, the night before
It is best to plan your day the night before and only ever plan out a day in detail one day at a time. There is no point in planning out your days for an entire week in advance if you don't even know what is going to happen tomorrow.

Planning one day ahead of time allows you to have the freshest information about what is going on: what is currently urgent and important and what is on your agenda tomorrow (e.g. meetings, fixed commitments).
The day plan that won't work for you
tasks on a calendar
When you think of a day plan, you might picture something like this:



This is the "tasks on a calendar" approach. This day schedule details exactly when you need to start and finish a task. And in this particular example every minute of the day is planned out.

While this approach can work well for some people (very few people in my experience), it is definitely not going to work well for you if your days are unpredictable.

Sure you can always delete or move things around when something else comes up... But the problem with adjusting your day plan during the day is that each little adjustment feels a bit like a failure. And that is an open invitation for feelings of frustration and defeat to creep in.

Plus, moving things around on a calendar is very tedious to do, don't you think? I mean, the whole point of a plan is to have something we can follow without much thinking. Constantly having to adjust it kind of defeats that purpose.
The flexibility attribute
How flexible is your day plan?
Each day plan has a certain level of flexibility. And the "tasks on a calendar" approach is on the lower end of the flexibility spectrum.

Even if we build in unscheduled time, each task is tightly coupled to a timeline. And that reduces the choice you have in deciding when a good time is to do a task on the fly.

As a general rule, the more unpredictable your days and the more interruptions and spontaneous tasks show up during your day, the more flexible your day planning method needs to be.
Your day plan should look more like this
The daily to-do list


On the other end of the flexibility spectrum we have the daily to-do list. The most flexible day plan there is.

A to-do list for your day IS a day plan. It's an intention of what you are going to do (the very definition of the word "plan") and it has a time frame attached to it when you intend to do it (today!).

The daily to-do list gives you maximum flexibility: You can do the tasks in any order, at any time and when something else comes up you can easily add it to your list without  having to adjust anything.

Of course, if you put so many tasks on your to-do list that you can barely finish it all in a day, you will also experience frustration when new tasks pop up throughout the day. Generally, the smaller your to-do list the more flexible it is. So definitely keep your daily to-do list on the shorter side to allow for spontaneous work and interruptions to fit in.
Finding your flexibility sweet spot
adjust, adjust, adjust
But maximum flexibility isn't always the right answer. There is a downside to too much flexibility.

A plan is supposed to help us focus on execution during the day, not wrangling with questions of what to do. We already answered those questions during planning!

But with a flexible day plan we are often confronted again with having to make lots of decisions about what to do next. And during a busy and stressful day, those decisions just add to our overwhelm making us less productive.

There are also specific benefits that come with a less flexible approach to day planning.

For example, the more specific our intention to do something is (aka what time and where) the more likely we are to do it and not procrastinate. We lose part of that benefit when we don't have a specific time attached to a task.

And finally, putting tasks on a schedule helps you to be more mindful about how long each task takes, which reduces the risk of putting way too much on your plate for a day.

So what if we want to have it all? Flexibility plus all the benefits of a more rigid plan. Is it possible?

Absolutely! The key is to find your flexibility sweet spot: just enough flexibility so you don't have to change plans throughout the day but not so much that you lose all the benefits of having a structured plan.

The way you find that sweet spot is to start somewhere and then make small adjustments to increase or decrease flexibility.

Since you know you need a lot of flexibility, start with the daily to-do list. You can then experiment with adding a bit more rigidity and structure.

You might also want to make use of some special to-do list techniques that provide the same benefits that a "tasks on a calendar" approach would. For example, you can assign a time estimate to each task to make sure you are not planning too much for your day.
Adding more structure to your daily to-do list
lowering flexibility
Here are a few ideas on how to add a bit more structure to your daily list. 

 Only assign a specific start time to a few tasks you are likely to procrastinate. Set a reminder on your phone or computer for those tasks.
 Sort your list based on priorities and work your way down from the top. No skipping!
 Section your to-do list into large time blocks and sort your tasks roughly into these time blocks: try morning, afternoon and evening for example.
 Mark your to-do list items with a priority markers (A, B, C) and add something that signals urgency (eg. !) to any items that MUST get done today. Use these to make quicker decisions what to do next throughout your day.

If you implement some of these strategies, your to-do list for the day might look something like this:




Summary
If your days are unpredictable you need a day plan with a lot of flexibility built in. A daily to-do list is the most flexible type of day plan. But too much flexibility has downsides, so you can experiment with adding a bit more structure into your daily to-do list with the following ideas:
How to make your daily to-do list more structured

 Only add a specific start time to one or two tasks you are likely to procrastinate
 Sort your list in the order you need to do the tasks, then just start from the top
 Use priority and urgency markers to know what can wait if necessary and what can't
 Break your daily to-do list into large time segments (e.g. morning, afternoon and evening)

General Day Planning Tips

 Only plan your next day in detail to ensure you have the freshest information
 Plan your day the night before
 Add time estimates to your tasks to make sure you don't over-schedule your day.
 The more interruptions and spontaneous tasks you have throughout the day, the shorter your to-do list should be

# What's microproductivity? The small habit that will lead you to big wins - Work Life by Atlassian

> ## Excerpt
> One step at a time: You know breaking projects down into small to-dos is a sure-fire way to get things done. But why? In this blog post, we explore the scientific reasons why microproductivity is an effective method for completing tasks efficiently.

_Take baby steps. You can’t move a mountain. When eating an elephant, take one bite at a time._

Have you heard sentiments like these before? Of course you have—breaking projects down into their component parts is oft-repeated advice when you’re tackling something big.

It’s a principle that we here at Trello like to call “microproductivity.” Did we just make that word up? You bet.

## Microproductivity Matters

We think it’s a term that perfectly captures the essence of this tried-and-true wisdom. It’s way easier (not to mention far less overwhelming) to focus on putting one foot in front of the other—rather than gazing with dread at the entire marathon route ahead of you.

“Breaking tasks down helps us to see large tasks as more approachable and doable, and reduces our propensity to procrastinate or defer tasks, because we simply don’t know where to begin,” explains <u><a href="https://melissagratias.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Melissa Gratias</a></u>, Ph.D., a workplace productivity coach and speaker.

That makes sense, right? But, here’s the thing: Have you ever stopped to ask yourself _why_ this tactic works? In the end, you’re doing roughly the same amount of work. So, what exactly makes this “one step at a time” strategy so helpful for all of us?

We dug into all of the science and the psychology to identify the reasons behind why we all prefer dining on “elephants” just one fork-full at a time.

## 1\. Your Brain Is Limited (No Offense)

“Human memory is flawed and limited,” says Dr. Gratias, “We all know this. We can’t remember everything.”

While memory limits can vary slightly from person to person, <u><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2864034/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">recent studies</a></u> show that our average working memory capacity (working memory is what’s used in mental tasks) is only three to five items. Anything more than that is bound to <u><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/beat-decision-fatigue-with-better-brain-habits" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">fall out of your brain</a></u>.

![lorelai-gilmore](What's%20microproductivity%20The%20small%20habit%20that%20will%20lead%20you%20to%20big%20wins%20-%20Work%20Life%20by%20Atlassian/lorelai-gilmore.gif)

“If we rely on our memory, we’ll stop at every step of the task and think, ‘What am I supposed to do next?’” explains Dr. Gratias, “Those stops are opportunities to get distracted, get off track, or miss a step.”

So, put simply, breaking a larger project down into smaller to-dos helps us easily identify what step we should take next.

There’s one more important note to make about this: This process shouldn’t happen mentally (because, in case you already forgot, your memory isn’t all that great).

These individual steps should be physically written down on your task list or in <u><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivityhttps://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/the-psychology-of-checklists-why-setting-small-goals-motivates-us-to-accomplish-bigger-things" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a checklist</a></u> on a Trello card, for example. You can refer back to that as your roadmap for your project when you can’t remember what comes next.

## 2\. You Work Better With Specific Goals

You have a major project on your plate—for example, you’re spearheading the launch of an entirely new website for your organization.

At first glance, your goal seems simple: get the new website ready. But, in reality, that’s a pretty vague objective. What qualifies as “ready”? When does it need to go live? How will you make this happen? Getting the entire website completed provides very little direction.

This is precisely why specificity is one of the core elements of the <u><a href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wm-principlesofmanagement/chapter/reading-goal-setting-theory/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Goal-Setting Theory</a></u>, established by psychologist Edwin Locke in the late 1960s.

In an article about the Goal-Setting Theory published in the <u><a href="http://oxfordre.com/psychology/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.001.0001/acrefore-9780190236557-e-12" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Psychology</a></u>, author and professor of Organizational Effectiveness, Gary Latham, cites four main reasons why specific goals are so powerful:

1.  Specific goals force us to make a choice to pursue them—and, as a result, **exclude anything that’s irrelevant**. This increases our focus, as well as our sense of purpose in pursuing that goal.
    
2.  Similarly, **specific goals incite effort**, which is another cornerstone of motivation.
    
3.  Specific goals inspire us to **be more persistent**, as we have a clear idea of what success looks like.
    
4.  Specific goals immediately get our wheels turning on the **strategies necessary to attain them**.
    

Of course, there’s plenty of other research that shows we tend to do better with specific goals. In just <u><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00995568" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">one study</a></u> of 162 undergraduate students who were asked to perform a computerized hand-eye coordination test, researchers found a correlation between goal specificity and level of performance. They found that if one controlled for goal difficulty, setting specific personal goals resulted in higher levels of productivity.

So, how does all of this tie back to the concept of microproductivity?

Well, breaking a large project down to bite-sized tasks allows you to set far more specific milestones (i.e. “write the homepage copy by the end of this week”) and, as a result, keep you motivated and moving in the right direction.

## 3\. Regular Feedback Keeps You On Track

Bigger projects can span weeks—sometimes even months or years. Can you think of anything more frustrating than investing all of that work into a task, only to discover at a much later date that you’re totally off track?

This is another reason why breaking down these large assignments into smaller parts is so crucial: You have the <u><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/avoid-the-seagull-effect-30-60-90-feedback-framework" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">opportunity to receive feedback</a></u> (which is another core tenet of the Goal-Setting Theory) and make adjustments when necessary.

It’s easy to think of feedback as demotivating, particularly when it’s harsh or constructive. However, science proves that feedback of any type—whether it’s positive or negative—inspires us to keep moving forward.

In a <u><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563215000527" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">study of 157 participants</a></u> who played a brain-training game, it was discovered that:

-   Negative feedback decreased feelings of competence, but still increased immediate game play.
    
-   Negative feedback motivated participants to repair their short-term performance.
    
-   Positive feedback fostered longer-term motivation in the participants.
    

So this shows that, perhaps surprisingly, both positive AND negative feedback are helpful in terms of making adjustments and staying committed to the task at hand. And, that’s something that you’ll be missing if you try to tackle an entire goal in one fell swoop.

“Breaking a large project down into smaller tasks allows you to get feedback, make course-corrections, and stay motivated toward the completion of it,” summarizes Dr. Gratias.

## 4\. Humans Hate Waiting For Results

“As humans, we’re not excellent at delayed gratification,” says Dr. Gratias, “We like to see progress, and we like to see progress quickly and often.”

![dumbledore-waiting](What's%20microproductivity%20The%20small%20habit%20that%20will%20lead%20you%20to%20big%20wins%20-%20Work%20Life%20by%20Atlassian/dumbledore-waiting.gif)

You’re probably familiar with that satisfied rush you get when you’re able to cross something off your to-do list. But, what’s happening in your brain when you check that box or scribble out that task? Well, your brain releases <u><a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/Dopamine-Functions.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">dopamine</a></u>—a neurotransmitter that’s connected to feelings of pleasure and motivation.

Here’s the thing: You like the way that feels, so you’ll make your best attempt to repeat that success. It’s something that neuroscientists call “<u><a href="https://grey.colorado.edu/mediawiki/sites/mingus/images/c/c0/HerdMingusOReilly10.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">self-directed learning</a></u>,” and it’s a big reason why splitting up large projects is so helpful.

By breaking those long-term assignments down, you open the door to experience more frequent rewards (and dopamine rushes!), which inspire you to keep taking steps forward.

“You’re wasting opportunities for an adrenaline rush by making a task too big,” shares Dr. Gratias, “We are working with our own desires for reward and feedback by breaking a large task down into its component parts.”

## Let’s Break It Down Now

You know by now that <u><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/personal-productivity-trello-boards" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">productivity is personal</a></u>—what works well for one person might backfire for another.

However, when it comes to feeling intimidated by large, daunting projects, the concept of segmenting that assignment into <u><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivityhttps://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/the-psychology-of-checklists-why-setting-small-goals-motivates-us-to-accomplish-bigger-things" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">smaller goals</a></u> is about as universally-helpful as a productivity tip can get.

“There are certain characteristics of how humans think and work that are common,” concludes Dr. Gratias, “Breaking down a large task is very useful for people who are feeling overwhelmed or are not making progress on their projects and tasks.”

The only thing left for you to do? Take that major project (you know, the one you’ve been continuously pushing to the back burner), split it up into individual tasks, and get to work. No, you might not eat that proverbial elephant all in one sitting. But, honestly, why would you want to?

# Too much to do? Then you need to master this one productivity skill | Amazing Marvin

> ## Excerpt
> One of the great productivity paradoxes is that the more we have to do the less we actually get done. 



Sound familiar?



Why does this happen? And more importantly what can you do mow through your to-dos when they threaten to overwhelm you?



Keep reading and find out.







Why is it so hard to get things done when you have too much to do?



Lowered motivation



As humans we feel motivated by making meaningful progress.



 We crave completion and visible progress lets us know that what we are doing is getting us closer to the end goal, which  motivates us to do more. 



But when your to-do list is 10 meters long, checking off 1 or even 10 tasks feels futile. It's like chipping away tiny slivers of a giant rock (and one that keeps growing too!). 



Not very motivating at all. No motivation ->  no action.



Procrastination due to negative emotions



By now you probably know that procrastination is an emotional problem. Anything that triggers negative emotions in us we tend to avoid. This is how we are built. Nature designed us to survive after all, not to get lots of things done.



And guess what is a negative emotion? Feeling overwhelmed!



If the list is long enough it can make even the most chill people feel stressed out and overwhelmed. 



And once that happens your deepest instincts are trying to keep you away from your massive to-do list.



Stress induced pre-frontal weakness



The double whammy here is that in order to override your instincts you need to use your pre-frontal cortex.  This the most modern part of the brain and also the most sensitive.



Unfortunately, stress directly inhibits the pre-frontal cortex.



So not only do you have a strong instinct to avoid that long to-do list that is stressing you out but the stress of it all also directly weakens the brain part you need to avoid that instinct. 



Trying to work off a really long to-do list



The solution: how to tackle a massive to-do list



So clearly, we need a solution here that squashes all these three issues at once. 



All since all three issues are directly related to the size of the list, we need to drastically reduce the list itself and come up with a short list we can work on.



Sounds simple and in some ways it is. But you might also be thinking: "I can't just eliminate the things I have to do in order to get a smaller list!" And you don't have to. Let me show you how.



Creating a short list to work from



The key idea is to create a much shorter list that you can work from.  You want to focus only on this short list until it is done. Then you can create another short list to tackle more work.So you don't have to delete any items permanently from the list (although you can of course). You are just creating an additional shorter list. So how do you get that short list? There are two ways to work on your giant list to get that short list:



You move things that you can't do or don't need to do within the next weeks or months into another separate "back burner" listYou pick the most important and/or urgent tasks to focus on (creating a curated focus list)



Ideally you utilize both of these strategies in your daily task management strategy. 



1. Shortening a long list by moving things to a back burner area



It's always best to first take out any items from your list that are not immediately relevant. Maybe they are just not that important, optional, depend on the completion of another item, are less important than other items on your list, don't have to be done for a while or have to be done on a specific day in the future.With a good task manager you should be able to do this step with ease and without any fear that any items get lost or forgotten. The Amazing Marvin app has a great back burner feature that makes this all really easy.

2. Creating a focus list



If you don't want to use the back burner strategy you can also directly jump to this one.  But even with the back burner method you might still be faced with a list that is too long.



The idea here is to curate a short list by picking only the most important and currently relevant tasks from your long list and focusing on that. A focus list comes in many variations. 



The daily list



You could make a list for your day for example, which is a very popular focus list. The key here is to make the length of it realistic so you can actually finish it in a day. Overscheduling your day is a very common mistake.



The daily to-do list



The weekly list



If a day list feels too strict, you can also make a weekly list instead. Picking everything you want to get done this week. Again, keep an eye out for the estimation total. There are only so many work hours in a week.



The weekly to-do list



Final thoughts



These two key strategies work for your Master List (everything you have to do) and individual projects that are just too long.



If you are ever faced with a to-do list that feels too long and daunting, think of these two strategies. You can create a back burner list, focus list or both. 



If you are struggling to shorten your long list with either of these basic methods, try to dig deeper into what is causing the difficulty. Sometimes everything feels important. Let me know in the comments if you struggle.



Because both of these types of strategies are so crucial to managing a large workload, I built all of this into features in Amazing Marvin.

# How to break down large projects & tasks into bite-sized tasks | Amazing Marvin

> ## Excerpt
> Do you want to feel like you got a ton of stuff done at the end of the day?

Do you want to make steady progress toward your life goals?

Of course you do!

The key to achieving this is to work off a daily to-do list and to make sure the tasks you put on your list are tasty tasks.

A tasty task is a task that is so well written that you almost can't resist doing it.

One key feature of any tasty task is that the task will take you no longer than 1 hour to complete! And if you struggle with procrastination and/or staying focused for long periods of time, your maximum task length should be smaller still — closer to 30min.

This sounds easy enough in theory. But many people struggle with creating small tasks.

If you have a huge task on your to-do list right now and are wondering how to make tiny bite-sized tasks out of it, this guide is for you!


How to break down a large task into small tasks
A step by step guide
Each of the following steps will help you break your large task into smaller pieces, each being a nice action step you can act on right away when you see it on your to-do list.
1) Define: project or task?
First, let's think about if our "task" is really a project. It's wise to make a clear distinction between tasks and projects.

A task is something you can do more or less in one sitting. If something takes you several months/weeks, multiple days or even the better part of a day it is best to think of your "task" as a project.

You might associate the word project with something from the corporate world or school. But almost anything we want to do and achieve can be thought of as a project. And it is actually a really good idea to turn most goals into projects!

So, is your task really a project? If so, continue to step 2.

If your task is not a project, but rather just a really long task, then skip ahead to step 3.
2) Break a large project into milestones
If your giant task turned out to be a project, let's check if your project is so large that it should be broken down further into individual milestones.

Here are two general rules to follow when it comes to milestones:

 If a project spans multiple months of work, create monthly milestones.
 If a project spans multiple weeks of work, create weekly milestones.

There are different ways to break a project into milestones and the best way depends on the nature of the project. But it is always important to clearly define what reaching a milestone entails.

Here are a few ways a large project can be broken down into smaller subprojects (aka milestones):

 different phases (e.g. when creating something: planning, producing, testing/refining)
 different categories (e.g. when planning a party: entertainment, food, invites)
 different parts (e.g. when cleaning your house: living room, bathroom, bedroom)

At this step you don't have to think about all the tasks inside the project yet. You are just trying to break the project down into smaller chunks which will make it easier to think of all the action steps involved.


If you can't think of a logical way to break down your project into milestones, just go to step 3 and start listing out all the action steps/tasks. Afterward you can divide them evenly into milestones and call them "Project Part I", "Project Part II", etc.


3) List out the steps
Take your large task or project and envision the individual steps you will do to finish the project. Write each one down.

Don't worry too much yet if the steps are too long or short. Just write every step down in a brainstorm kind of way.

If you are struggling with thinking of concrete action steps, it could be a sign that you are not familiar enough with the type of project or task and need more info.

In that case, just think of the steps you need to take in order to gain more clarity. Write them down as tasks:


Figure out who can help me plan project X




Contact Person Y to ask how to do project X




Read up on how to do project X




Google how to do project X


 

Sometimes a project is just very complex or needs to stay flexible and you can't list all the steps in advance. For those projects, just make sure you always have at least the next 2-3 action steps listed out so there is always something to do.

After this step you should have a list of much smaller steps already. Now ask yourself for each step, how long will this take me? If the answer is longer than 1 hour (or whatever upper limit you decided) go to step 4 to break your task down further.

If a task will take you less than 1 hour to do but still feels a bit complex, also read through step 4 to see if you want to break it down further.
4) Break multi-step tasks into single-step tasks
Often we combine multiple steps into a single task. This is completely fine for sequences we are performing all the time, like making a phone call. We wouldn't write out: pick up phone, navigate to dial screen, type in number, press call. But if we were making a note for our grandmother we would... because she is not used to the sequence.

So think about how easy this step is for you to perform if you had to do it right now. If it really feels like a single simple action to you, go to step 5.

Otherwise we want to break this multi-step task into single-step tasks.

Often multi-step tasks use broad verbs: "do", "finish" or "work on".  (If you don't use verbs in your tasks, read this post on how to write good tasks.)

So try to use more specific verbs for your smaller tasks. The more specific the verb, the easier it will be for your brain to ease into the action when it's time to get the task done.

For example, if your large task/project is: "Do Taxes" you can break it up into the following steps:


Make checklist of documents needed for taxes




Find all documents on checklist




Download all tax documents




Buy "TurboTax" Software




Ask John if he will sit and do taxes with me




Fill out tax forms




Bring taxes to the post office


 

You should now have a list of steps that are highly focused on single actions. But your individual steps might still take longer than your ideal task size... When will this end?!

Almost there! We are getting to the last 2 techniques.
5) Break long stretches of work into smaller sessions
Time Boxing
To break down a single step action into smaller tasks, you can use a nifty trick called time boxing.

Time boxing is adding an artificial time limit to a task. Let's take the tax example from before: We estimate that actually filing the taxes will take us 3 hours.

We can then create three identical tasks, each one hour long:


File taxes for 1 hour




File taxes for 1 hour




File taxes for 1 hour


 

As soon as you get to work on this you will start a 1 hour timer and check off the task when the timer is up.

If you need longer to complete the filing, make more time-boxed tasks. If you finish sooner, remove the extra tasks. Easy peasy.
Alternative to time boxing
Similarly, you can break down large tasks by other numerical units:


Fill out 2 pages of tax report




Read 5 pages of...




Email 3 people




Write 300 words on...




Do Exercises 2.3 and 2.5




Sort out one box of old stuff


 

After going through all these steps you should now have nice bite-sized tasks you can do one at a time.

Summary
In your to-do list you want to have tasks that are specific and can be completed in one session, so they need to be short! Follow these steps to break down any large project.
How to break down a large project or task into small tasks:

 Figure out if a task is really a project
 Break a large project into smaller subprojects/milestones
 Write down all action steps you can think of for each subproject
 If you can't think of all steps in advance just write out the next 2-3 action steps
 If necessary, break down any large multi-action step into smaller, more specific single-action steps
 Turn a long single-action step into multiple time-boxed or number-limited small tasks.

Do you want to feel like you got a ton of stuff done at the end of the day?

Do you want to make steady progress toward your life goals?

Of course you do!

The key to achieving this is to work off a daily to-do list and to make sure the tasks you put on your list are [tasty tasks](http://blog.amazingmarvin.com/three-simple-rules-writing-great-tasks-todo-list/).

A tasty task is a task that is so well written that you almost can’t resist doing it.

One key feature of any tasty task is that the task will take you **no longer than 1 hour to complete**! And if you struggle with procrastination and/or staying focused for long periods of time, your maximum task length should be smaller still — closer to 30min.

This sounds easy enough in theory. But many people struggle with creating small tasks.

If you have a huge task on your to-do list right now and are wondering **how to make tiny bite-sized tasks out of it**, this guide is for you!

![How to break large tasks into small tasks](How%20to%20break%20down%20large%20projects%20&%20tasks%20into%20bite-sized%20tasks%20%20Amazing%20Marvin/cover_break_large_tasks_into_small_ones-1024x301.png)

How to break large projects into small tasks

## How to break down a large task into small tasks

### A step by step guide

Each of the following steps will help you break your large task into smaller pieces, each being a nice action step you can act on right away when you see it on your to-do list.

## 1) Define: project or task?

First, let’s think about if our “task” is really a project. It’s wise to **make a clear distinction between tasks and projects.**

**A task is something you can do more or less in one sitting.** If something takes you several months/weeks, multiple days or even the better part of a day it is best to think of your “task” as a project.

You might associate the word project with something from the corporate world or school. But **almost anything we want to do and achieve can be thought of as a project**. And it is actually a really good idea to turn most goals into projects!

So, is your task really a project? If so, continue to step 2.

If your task is not a project, but rather just a really long task, then skip ahead to step 3.

## 2) Break a large project into milestones

If your giant task turned out to be a project, let’s check if your project is so large that it should be broken down further into individual milestones.

**Here are two general rules to follow when it comes to milestones:**

-   If a project **spans multiple months of work**, create monthly milestones.
-   If a project **spans multiple weeks of work**, create weekly milestones.

There are different ways to break a project into milestones and the best way depends on the nature of the project. But it is always important to **clearly define what reaching a milestone entails**.

Here are a few ways a large project can be broken down into smaller subprojects (aka milestones):

-   **different phases** (e.g. when creating something: planning, producing, testing/refining)
-   **different categories** (e.g. when planning a party: entertainment, food, invites)
-   **different parts** (e.g. when cleaning your house: living room, bathroom, bedroom)

At this step you don’t have to think about all the tasks inside the project yet. You are just trying to break the project down into smaller chunks which will make it easier to think of all the action steps involved.

![](How%20to%20break%20down%20large%20projects%20&%20tasks%20into%20bite-sized%20tasks%20%20Amazing%20Marvin/bulb.png)

If you can’t think of a logical way to break down your project into milestones, just go to step 3 and start listing out all the action steps/tasks. Afterward you can divide them evenly into milestones and call them “Project Part I”, “Project Part II”, etc.

## 3) List out the steps

Take your large task or project and envision the individual steps you will do to finish the project. Write each one down.

Don’t worry too much yet if the steps are too long or short. Just **write every step down in a brainstorm kind of way.**

**If you are struggling with thinking of concrete action steps**, it could be a sign that you are not familiar enough with the type of project or task and need more info.

In that case, **just think of the steps you need to take in order to gain more clarity.** Write them down as tasks:

Figure out who can help me plan project X

Contact Person Y to ask how to do project X

Read up on how to do project X

Google how to do project X

Sometimes a project is just very complex or needs to stay flexible and you can’t list all the steps in advance. For those projects, just **make sure you always have at least the next 2-3 action steps listed out** so there is always something to do.

After this step you should have a list of much smaller steps already. Now ask yourself for each step, how long will this take me? If the answer is longer than 1 hour (or whatever upper limit you decided) go to step 4 to break your task down further.

If a task will take you less than 1 hour to do but still feels a bit complex, also read through step 4 to see if you want to break it down further.

## 4) Break multi-step tasks into single-step tasks

**Often we combine multiple steps into a single task**. This is completely fine for sequences we are performing all the time, like making a phone call. We wouldn’t write out: pick up phone, navigate to dial screen, type in number, press call. But if we were making a note for our grandmother we would… because she is not used to the sequence.

So think about how easy this step is for you to perform if you had to do it right now. If it really feels like a single simple action to you, go to step 5.

Otherwise we want to break this multi-step task into single-step tasks.

Often multi-step tasks use broad verbs: “do”, “finish” or “work on”.  (If you don’t use verbs in your tasks, [read this post on how to write good tasks](https://blog.amazingmarvin.com/three-simple-rules-writing-great-tasks-todo-list/).)

So try to use more specific verbs for your smaller tasks. **The more specific the verb, the easier it will be for your brain to ease into the action when it’s time to get the task done.**

For example, if your large task/project is: “Do Taxes” you can break it up into the following steps:

Make checklist of documents needed for taxes

Find all documents on checklist

Download all tax documents

Ask John if he will sit and do taxes with me

Bring taxes to the post office

You should now have a list of steps that are highly focused on single actions. But your individual steps might still take longer than your ideal task size… When will this end?!

Almost there! We are getting to the last 2 techniques.

## 5) Break long stretches of work into smaller sessions

#### Time Boxing

To break down a single step action into smaller tasks, you can use a nifty trick called time boxing.

**Time boxing is adding an artificial time limit to a task**. Let’s take the tax example from before: We estimate that actually filing the taxes will take us 3 hours.

We can then create three identical tasks, each one hour long:

As soon as you get to work on this you will **start a 1 hour timer and check off the task when the timer is up**.

If you need longer to complete the filing, make more time-boxed tasks. If you finish sooner, remove the extra tasks. Easy peasy.

#### Alternative to time boxing

Similarly, you can break down large tasks by other numerical units:

Fill out 2 pages of tax report

Sort out one box of old stuff

After going through all these steps you should now have nice bite-sized tasks you can do one at a time.

###### Summary

In your to-do list you want to have tasks that are specific and can be completed in one session, so they need to be short! Follow these steps to break down any large project.

##### **How to break down a large project or task into small tasks:**

-   Figure out if a task is really a project
-   Break a large project into smaller subprojects/milestones
-   Write down all action steps you can think of for each subproject
-   If you can’t think of all steps in advance just write out the next 2-3 action steps
-   If necessary, break down any large multi-action step into smaller, more specific single-action steps
-   Turn a long single-action step into multiple time-boxed or number-limited small tasks.

# How long should your to-do list be? | Amazing Marvin

> ## Excerpt
> Glad you asked! The length of your to-do list has a huge impact on your productivity.

By manipulating the length of your to-do  list, you can hack your productivity. The right list length will help you feel less overwhelmed and get more done. 
What list are we talking about?
There are two types of to-do lists: endless and finite. The most popular finite list is the daily to-do list, which is what we will discuss in this post. It's the one you have the most control over and the one that has the biggest impact on your productivity.


How long should your daily to-do list be?
Number of tasks vs. total time
The perfect daily to-do list is one that you can finish.

It is better to make a list that is too short rather than too long. You can always add things when you finish early (which will feel incredible!).

On the other hand, still having open tasks at the end of the day feels really bad. You are also more likely to procrastinate on a long list because long lists trigger overwhelm.
How can I know if my daily to-do list is too long?
When it comes to length we can look at two things: the number of tasks on a list and the total time to complete it.

You should always start with thinking about how many hours long your daily to-do list should be. This number is more or less fixed and the number of tasks you add will be guided by how much time you have.

The number of tasks on your list is important too, of course, but it isn't fixed like the available time. We get into how to manipulate the task number below.
How many hours should a to-do list take to finish?
Ultimately, our day has limited hours in it. And if we want to finish our daily to-do list we have to consider how many hours we can realistically work on our list so we know how much to put on there.

There are two main factors that determine how many hours we can work on our to-do list each day.

 How many hours are available for working on your to-do list after subtracting time for other commitments, sleep, eating, hygiene, etc.?
 How many hours can you really be productive each day? Mental and physical energy is limited.

Taking both of these things into consideration you should end up with an estimate around 1-8 hours.

Based on that number, it's a good idea to build in a buffer. The buffer accounts for possible interruptions, inefficiencies switching from task to task, and tasks that we underestimate. So subtract about 20%-30% from your initial time estimate to arrive at your final time total.


Add a time estimate to each task and total it up as you create tasks to make sure you are staying within your allotted time.


How many tasks should you have in your daily to-do list?
OK, so let's say you figured out that your ideal to-do list for today is about 4 hours long. How many tasks is that?

It depends on how long each task is, of course. This is were it gets interesting.

You can have two lists that include the exact same amount of work and will take you the same amount to complete (4 hours), but that look very different. It all comes down to "task granularity".
What is task granularity?
Task granularity is all about how much you break down a larger task:


Cook dinner


Low granularity



Make salad




Roast potatoes




Grill chicken


Medium granularity



Wash salad leaves




Chop Tomatoes




Chop cucumbers




Make salad dressing




Peel potatoes




Season potatoes




Put potatoes into oven




Season chicken




Grill chicken


High granularity
Same task, three very different looking to-do lists.
What level of task granularity is the best one?
It depends on the type of task, your personal preference, and your productivity strengths and weaknesses (Can't focus for long? Have a hard time getting started on big tasks?).

But medium granularity works best for most.

As a guideline: I recommend making tasks that are maximum 1 hour long. If you are struggling with procrastination try to not make tasks longer than 30min.

Also, the more complex your work and the more you are dreading it, the shorter the tasks on your list should be.

Task granularity is an important tool you can use to manipulate your perception of a to-do list. If you notice that a long list overwhelms you but you have no issue getting started on big tasks and staying focused, then go with a high granularity.

If you tend to procrastinate tasks that seem overwhelming and complex, break them down to create many smaller tasks.
Conclusion: How many tasks to put on your daily to-do list
Just give me a number
The average productive human (and most people don't exactly fall into that category) has about 6 hours of good work in them per day. And a nice granularity level for most people is somewhere in the middle: between 30-60 min for each task. That means a good daily to-do list for an average productive person has between 6-12 tasks on it.

Again, to-do lists are a highly individual thing. Many swear by having only 3 tasks on their list every day (obviously larger tasks) and others do best by having very long and detailed lists. So figure out what works best for you.

Summary
The length of your to-do list has a big impact on your productivity. Make sure your to-do list can be finished in a reasonable amount of time, and manipulate the length perception to make it less overwhelming.
How long should your to-do list be?

 First figure out how many hours you have available in the day to work on your to-do list
 Aim for a list that takes you about 70% of the time that you have available in order to have a built-in buffer
 Use time estimates while planning tasks to make sure you are not exceeding your time limit for the day
 Determine a good level of task granularity to make a list that isn't overwhelming to you
 Based on averages, a good daily to-do list has about 6-12 tasks on it. But ultimately it is highly dependent on the type of work and person

# Dear Marvin | Teacher with ADHD and too much to do needs a good system | Amazing Marvin

> ## Excerpt
> Dear Marvin,

I am a secondary English teacher in the UK teaching students from 11-16. Being a teacher means I play so many roles, and I really struggle to try to do all of it. I just love the teaching part and get so invested in that, that I sometimes forget or delegate all my other tasks.

I have a hard time deciding what to do each day and finding a balance. My schedule is so different each day, that it's hard to plan for things.

I also have ADHD and struggle with 'hyper-focusing'. The way I procrastinate is I get too into a task. So for example, I have to create a lesson for my year 9s. There is a lesson available but I think the resources are not great and wouldn't benefit my students. I will then 'hyper-focus' and spend ages creating an amazing resource that is really helpful-- but then I haven't done any of the other 15 things I needed to do. I am a 'productive' procrastinator...

Anyways, I ended up writing down all the things that are my responsibilities at work. How would you use Amazing Marvin to organize this?

 Plan 4-5 lessons a day and printing resources (but each day is different--and usually the lesson will need to be adapted based on the previous lesson..and sometimes I have 5 classes, and once in a while I will only teach 2 classes)
 Assigning and monitoring homework-- I always forget what I assign...
 Form tutor duty (breaks and lunches I have students in my classroom asking for guidance etc-- I also am responsible for making sure the kids know what they need to do each day, get forms signed etc)
 Pastoral duties - calling parents, following up with child protection issues, mentoring vulnerable students
 Marking and Grading - Every 2 weeks I have about 10-12 hours of additional marking that needs to be completed. Student results have a hard deadline at the end of term, but I usually don't know when those deadlines are...)
 Various Admin duties -- completing department projects, random things that pop up
 Department meetings and after school duties- preping for meetings (I have 2-3 meetings a week that go until 5)
 Extracurricular Programs that I run - Needs to be organised and timely...something I struggle with.
 Training program - Assignments, long term projects, weekly meetings

Please help! Also, thank you so much for this awesome product. It has been really helpful so far.

Kind Regards,
Teal


Dear Teal,

Wow, you sure have a lot of different responsibilities and a lot to do! But no worries, a good system will make all that work seem much more manageable, and I will do my best to help you find that system.

You might want to read through this post with a notepad and jot down any idea that you want to try. And when you are finished make a point to try one idea right away. As you try things, reflect each day what went well and what you are still struggling with. If the pain point is large enough go to your note and try another idea that could solve your problem.

Before we jump into some specific ideas, I want to point out some things to keep in mind while embarking on your journey of finding your perfect productivity system.
Developing a Productivity System
The right approach and mindset
There are ton of different ways to set up a productivity system. But don’t let that overwhelm you. Any type of system is better than none, so you just have to start somewhere.

This post should give you plenty of ideas on where to start. But don't feel like you have to implement everything right away. One step at a time.

The only way to find the perfect productivity system is through trial and error. You won't know if something works for you until you try it.

Make sure to regularly reflect on what works well in your system and what needs improvement. Then tweak and repeat.

Never feel discouraged when something isn’t working, just see it as an opportunity to try something else. You will often get valuable insights when you ask "Why is this not working?" and that will help you find a better solution.

And always give a new strategy some time before you decide to keep, modify, or discard it. A strategy that feels a bit clunky at first might become your new best friend once you get used to it.
Attributes of the perfect Productivity System
The end goal
It's a good idea to start off with painting a clear picture of the end goal.

What problems specifically should your system solve for you? How should your workflow make you feel?

Having a list of specific points gives you something to check your current system against.

From what you wrote it sounds like a good system for you should:

 reduce anxiety and worry about forgetting things
 make your entire workload feel more manageable
 help you feel in total control of your tasks
 create a nice balance between your responsibilities
 remove the question marks about what to do when
 motivate you to get things done you don't love to do
 help you remember tasks at the right time (e.g. homework you assigned)

One day at a time
The key to being able to manage a lot of responsibilities without feeling overwhelmed is a system that allows you to only focus on one day at a time. If you are confronted with ALL your outstanding work each and every day you'll quickly feel paralyzed by overwhelm.

So your system should allow you to contemplate one day at a time.

Reading through all the points below should help you get lots of ideas on how to achieve that. Specifically the paragraphs on long-term planning.
A non-overwhelming daily to-do list
Since you will be focusing on one day at a time, you want to also make sure that your daily to-do plan is appealing to work on.

Here are three important points that help make that happen:

 Write tasty tasks -> start with a verb, be specific, make them short
 Make a list that is doable. The hours scheduled should be realistic. (time estimates can help)
 Prioritize and organize the items on your list so you can always easily figure out what to do next. Use sections, stars, due dates, and task order to do so.

Capturing Ideas and Tasks
A key habit for any productivity system
One important tenant of all good productivity systems is that you should never try to store things in your head. Any idea or task should be captured in an outside system as quickly as possible.

This keeps your head free to think and ensures you won't forget anything.

Regularly capturing things is a habit. It will take some time to always remember to write a task or idea down. In the beginning it can help to make a daily or weekly task "Capture tasks" where you brainstorm things to add to your master list.
Productivity Apps for capturing tasks and ideas
I recommend having two places where you capture things: one place for tasks (things that need doing soon) and one place to capture more general ideas.
Task manager for capturing tasks
It makes me happy to hear that you are using Amazing Marvin as your task manager. Great choice! ;)

Any task that comes up should be immediately put into your task manager. In Marvin you can use the #Inbox shortcut in your day view to send a task straight to your Inbox in the master list whenever you don't want to forget a task but don't want to do it right away. Or use the "+" sign to schedule it to a specific day (tomorrow or in a week, etc.). If you are not in the day view (e.g. Super Focus Mode) and you think of something else to do, press the spacebar to get an input field where you can send tasks to your master list from anywhere.
Note/document app for capturing ideas
In addition to Marvin you might also like to use a note and document app such as Google Drive (free) for capturing ideas.

Whenever you have an idea for a lesson or a project, write it down in your notes. You might get a burst of ideas for activities to do with your class or all of a sudden have a lot of ideas for test questions.

It's great to capture those ideas as they come up in one place. Not only does it feel like a relief to know you won't forget them but it will also make your work later on a lot easier when all you already have something to work with -- especially when your notes are nice and organized.
Marvin setup ideas
Let's get the party started
Let's get into some ideas on how you can use Marvin to manage your workload and specific solutions to your problems.

Try them out and modify them to your heart's content. You'll always know best what is working for you and what isn't.
Master List Setup
Create main categories and subcategories
The first thing to do is set up your master list. I would make a main category for each of your responsibilities and pick a color that you associate with that type of work.

For the teaching it might also be a good idea to make a subcategory for each class you are teaching. Here is an example of what your master list might look like:


Perform a Braindump
Next you want to try and get every task and project you currently have to do out of your brain and into the master list. Some people like to just dump it all into the Inbox first and sort it later.
Create projects
Once you have a nice list of all your current to-dos, go through them and think about which one of these are actually projects. Anything that includes multiple steps (that you can't all do in one work session of 30-60min) or spans multiple days/weeks is a project.
File the tasks and projects
Sort the projects and tasks into their categories if you created them in the Inbox.
Assign due dates
Assign a due date to tasks and projects that have a hard deadline.
Prioritize
If you want to  prioritize your to-dos, turn on the prioritization strategies for tasks and projects and mark items as red, orange, or yellow. It might be also a good idea to quickly sort items so whatever you need to do first is on top.
Remember to capture tasks
Moving forward it's all about capturing any task that comes up in your master list (as discussed above) and doing regular maintenance work in the master list so your tasks are always relevant.

To help with maintenance, you can use the "Weekly Review" strategy or set up a recurring task to remind you to go through the master list to delete items, create new ones, add tasks to projects, assign due dates etc. Strategies such as "Missing Next Steps" and "Staleness alert" can help you notice when something needs your attention.
Recurring Tasks and Projects
The next thing I would do is set up recurring tasks and projects. This is super helpful to ensure you don't forget any regular duties.

Go through your list of work and think about each item and whether it could be turned into a recurring item. The more recurring tasks the less manual adding you will have to do throughout the week and the less likely something will get forgotten.

It might make sense to create recurring tasks for things like:

 meeting prep
 meetings
 lesson planning
 making a tutor schedule
 etc.

Don't worry if something is technically recurring but not always exactly the same. During your weekly planning you can always delete recurring tasks or move them to a different day. And you can always modify your recurring tasks or use saved items instead for projects that have irregular intervals.
Do more non-urgent but important tasks
Recurring tasks can be useful to get you to do thing that you technically want to do more of but are not urgent (no external deadline, no immediate consequence of delaying it) and which therefore most often just don't happen because there is so much else to do.

This could be things like:

 reaching out to vulnerable students
 brainstorming ideas for extracurricular programs

Making progress on long-term projects
Recurring tasks can also help you to make sure you make regular progress on big long-term projects. Instead of pushing it off and then completing a project all at once, set up a recurring task within a project to spend 15 to 30 min on that project daily or a few times per week. Make sure you have already broken down the project somewhere (either in a separate document or inside Marvin as tasks or notes) so you always know what to work on when it's time to work on the project.
Section Setup
As you probably have already figured out, in Marvin you can break up your daily to-do list into sections. Any kind of sections!

The type of sections you chose can make a big difference in your daily workflow. So definitely experiment a lot with different kind of setups. A few ideas below that you can mix and match.
Essential and bonus sections
One idea that might work well for you is to use one section for tasks that absolutely have to get done today ("essential") and one section for tasks that you can work on if you have time (and energy) left over after completing all the essential tasks. You could call this section "bonus".
Separate essential "at school" and "at home" tasks
You might even want to create two separate sections for your essential tasks, one for tasks you want to do while you are at school and one for things you do at home or after classes are done.

Alternatively, you can add labels with the location context and then filter by them depending on where you are.
Teaching section for in class tasks
In addition to these two sections you could also have a section called "Teaching" where you put tasks that you want to remember while you are in class:

 Checking in with a specific student
 Signing a form for someone
 Asking about the homework assignment

Since you have several classes, it might be a good idea to add a specific label for each class to a task. So whenever you are in a class, click the label to filter the tasks so you only see the ones relevant for that specific class.


Extra Section Tip
Click on a section to only see the tasks from that section.  This helps to make your list feel less overwhelming so you can focus better on what is relevant right now. In addition to this, if you ever feel overwhelmed by multiple tasks, immediately go into the Super Focus Mode. It can make a world of difference.

 
Planning your months, weeks, and days
Doing it right
Now that the basics of your system are in place lets get into "using the system". There are basically two main types of activities in a work system: planning and working.
Why planning matters
Planning is all about making it easier for you to do the work later on. You decide ahead of time what is important to do next and figure out when to do what, so that throughout the day you can focus on getting the work done.

The way you plan makes all the difference between feeling overwhelmed or calm later on and how much you actually get done. Planning ahead also ensures that you'll start on projects early enough and helps you spot things you need to delegate when there is still time to do so.
Monthly Planning
At the start of each month it's helpful to do a monthly planning session. You can set up a recurring task for this to make sure you don't forget. It also helpful to have a checklist that lists the steps you take during your monthly planning. You will build this as you go.
Figuring out which projects to do this month
Monthly planning is all about figuring out what should have priority this month. Check your calendar for deadlines of projects and figure out if it's time to start them this month. Create a project in your Master List for everything that needs your attention this month.
Break large projects into monthly subprojects (milestones)
Large projects that span past this month benefit from having a subproject that you can complete within the next month. Think of this like a milestone you want to reach for the larger project.
Plan projects with the "Planning ahead" strategy
If you use the "Planning ahead" strategy (which is helpful if you have a lot of projects) you can assign the projects you want to complete this month to this month. You can also allocate projects to specific weeks within that month or leave that to your weekly planning. Those projects are now more easily accessible for task scheduling in your planning sidebar and in the dashboard.
Prepare projects for action
Next, you can also go through each of the projects and write down some project notes and add the first step to take for each project. This will make it easier to get started later on. Alternatively, you can do this as part of your weekly planning.
Weekly Planning
Each week I also recommend doing a weekly planning session. This will make your daily planning easier. Just as for the monthly planning it can be helpful to have a checklist for your weekly planning.
Pick projects to focus on this week
Figure out which projects you want to tackle this week and allocate them accordingly if you are using the "Planning ahead" strategy. If you haven't already it's now time to add 1-2 next steps (tasks) to each project and try to get a better idea of what you need to do to get it done. You can even schedule some tasks to a specific day this week already.
Map out your week with time blocks or time goals
If you are using any of the strategies recommended below (time blocking, time goals) it makes sense to map out your week during your weekly planning session. 
Daily Planning
Planning for the next day is best done the night before, where you have the freshest information about what is on your plate. It will also help you to feel at ease and sleep like a baby when you know that the next day is already planned.

Depending on what you did during your weekly planning you might already have most of the days scheduled. But it's always a good idea to go through it again and make sure the day plan makes sense.
Don't over-schedule your day
When planning a day there are a few pitfalls. The most common one is trying to cram way too much into one day. There are only so many hours one can be productive in a day, so knowing that limit and making sure you stick to it is vital.

A too ambitious plan can overwhelm before you even get started and leaving things undone feels very demotivating. So it's always best to err on the side of caution and plan too little. Time estimates are great for helping you create a more realistic day plan.

Planning a realistic day sounds simple, but in practice it is extremely difficult to do. Our desire to get a lot done each day coupled with a natural optimism that tomorrow we'll have endless motivation and energy makes it very difficult.

Having a bonus section is often a good compromise. It allows you to add a lot of tasks to your day that you want to get done, but it feels less bad when you don't finish all of them as they were "bonus" anyway.

When planning your day it is also very important to leave enough leeway for spontaneous events and tasks that come up. Try to get a feel for how much of your day is taken up with these kinds of things and leave room in your calculations for those events.
Have a system for day planning
A common problem with day planning is not knowing what to do.  I go into a couple solutions for this dilemma in the section "Deciding what to do each day & finding balance" below. But if you figured out what projects to focus on this week, then picking tasks for your day should already be a lot easier.

When picking tasks for your day, you can click on the "This week" tab to see your projects for this week.
Solutions for your unique productivity challenges
You mentioned a couple of specific challenges you face. Here are a couple of ideas on how to tackle them.
Hyperfocusing on specific tasks at the expense of others
Being able to hyperfocus on a task as someone with ADHD means that you find that task interesting and stimulating. Which is great! But of course, the challenge is to not get so lost in those tasks that you neglect everything else.
Reward yourself with interesting tasks
Try to use those interesting tasks to motivate yourself to do other tasks. Make a rule that whenever you feel excited about a task, you must get something else done first. The stimulating task will then act as a reward for getting something you dread done. This can be highly motivating!
Use timers
To ensure you don't get lost in the fun task, set a time limit ahead of time and use a timer.  Depending on the length of the task, try to aim for 30-60min reward sessions. Once the timer goes off you have to complete another must-do task before allowing yourself to continue working on your task of choice.

As an added bonus, the time limit will also help to you to not get lost so much in unimportant details because you will want to make as much progress as you can within the time limit.
Plan projects in advance and make it a point to get started on the first task right away
Sometimes projects that are not part of our regular workday routine can be a real struggle to work on. But there are a few things you can do to ensure those projects don't get left behind.
Setting up a project
Make project planning part of your monthly or weekly review. Each month think about what projects are on your plate. Create them in Marvin as a project so they become real. Then assign a due date if they have a deadline.

Next, it's important to make it easier for your future self to actually work on this project. Think about the individual steps you have to take to complete this project and write those steps down. You can either add them as tasks to the project in Marvin or write them down into the project note (turn on notes strategy) first. Breaking down a large project is sometimes easier in a text document where you can edit and group things quickly.

With big projects it can be difficult to anticipate all the tasks that will come up. And upi don't have to think of all the steps ahead of time. But make sure you always have at least 1-2 tasks inside the project that are the next steps you have to take in order to make progress on that project.
Planning time to work on the project
Once you've outlined the project, you'll probably have a better idea of how long it will take you to do the project. You can now calculate how much time you should spend on this project each week or day to get it completed in a timely fashion. Generally, it is best to build in a lot of leeway (add 30-50% of your first estimate).

During your weekly review, plan when you'll spend the necessary time on that project this week. Pick the next step and add it to a day where you have some time. You could use the time blocking strategy here, where you map out your fixed commitments (lessons, lesson planning, tutoring, leisure, etc.) and then figure out if there is a slot available for working on projects that week. This will help you see if you actually have enough time to do it all by yourself.

As mentioned earlier, you could also set up a recurring task to work a bit each day or week on a project.
Get started as soon as possible
Getting started is always the hardest part. If you know you have a project to do but wait to get started, the hurdle to work on that project will become larger and larger each day that passes. So getting started as soon as possible is key.

Try to get started (even if it is just 10min) on the project as soon as possible. Outline one step to take and take it right after you are done planning. This will make it much easier in the future to continue working on the project.
Deciding what to do each day & finding balance
With so many different responsibilities it is no wonder that you struggle with analysis paralysis. Wondering what you should be working on is a really big productivity killer and stress producer. So getting a handle on that is a top priority.

You want to have a simple set of rules that you can stick to while planning your months, weeks, and days. The key is to set up the right rules.

Good rules will be easy and clear to follow so you don't struggle with making decisions. And good rules will automatically create the right balance for you.
Themed days
Some people swear by having themed days. Besides your regular daily work of teaching and lesson planning you could say Monday is "Admin day" , Wednesday is "Training day" and Friday is "Extracurricular Programs day". This allows you to not think about part of your workload for most days, which helps to make it feel more manageable on a day-to-day basis. It also reduces your choices for your daily planning so there is less question about when to do what as a large part is already taken care of by the day themes.

There is no specific way to implement day themes in Marvin yet (coming later this year). But you could type in the theme of the day into each day note on top of your to-do list as part of your weekly planning.


Time blocking
If having themed days does not work well, maybe try the more flexible approach of time blocking. Map out your week as part of the weekly planning with time blocks. Start with the fixed commitments (lessons, meeting) and then add in time to work on different projects and areas of responsibility.

You can see the time totals for each category on the left. This lets you adjust your plan so you can make sure each area has the right time dedicated to it based on your current workload.

Experiment with time block size and day variability. Some people like to have only a few different time blocks per day, others like to have a large variety each day to keep them interested. Be mindful of what you are going for and why.
Daily time targets
A similar idea to time blocks but without the pre-committed time associated with it can be achieved with time targets for each day.

Turn on the "Daily time targets" strategy and set up on which days you want to spend how much time on your categories or projects. Then during the day try to meet the time goals via time tracking your tasks.



Just as with time blocking, experiment with variability until you find something that works well for you. For example you might only want to set up time goals for work categories that you struggle to get started on or find a good balance in and leaving out the teaching and lesson planning, which you will do anyway.

And as always, tweak everything until you find something that works well for you. Experiment with the target size (30 min or 90 min etc.), the weekdays and combination of categories you like to work on for each day.

This strategy often works well for people with ADHD, since the almost game like nature of trying to meet a time goal is challenging and can add some extra stimulation.


Keeping track of homework assignments
If you plan homework ahead of time set up a document or spreadsheet on Google Drive where you write down the description of the homework, the class, assignment and collection date. An ideal time to do this is during lesson planning.

Immediately after creating the homework plan, create a task for each of the homework assignments with a label for the class and schedule it for the day the homework needs to be collected.



You could even set a reminder inside Marvin. To do that turn on the reminder strategy, add a specific time to be reminded as part of the task title and set the reminder for the time you usually collect homework. And make sure to have the sound on.

If you do not plan homework assignments ahead of time, create the task to collect the homework as soon as you assign the homework.
Extra Strategy recommendations
Using Time Estimates
When we have more to do than there are hours in the day, building our time awareness and managing our time is of utmost importance.

I would encourage you to turn on the time estimate strategy for a while and so you can assign a time estimate to any task you create.

It does make adding tasks take a few seconds longer (but it’s really easy to do in Marvin) but the benefits you reap from using time estimates are enormous.

After a while when you feel like you have become more aware of how long things take, you can stop using the time estimates strategy.


Closing Thoughts
I hope that this will give you lots of ideas on how to build your own productivity system.

Remember it is all about continuously tweaking the system. Whenever something doesn't feel smooth try to identify the problem and come up with some ideas for solutions to try. You know you are on the right track when your workload starts to feel more manageable and you feel a sense of control.

As new features come out in Marvin, read through their description and integrate them to solve pain points and improve things further

Happy teaching!

Dear Marvin,

I am a secondary English teacher in the UK teaching students from 11-16. Being a teacher means I play so many roles, and I really struggle to try to do all of it. I just love the teaching part and get so invested in that, that I sometimes forget or delegate all my other tasks.

I have a hard time deciding what to do each day and finding a balance. My schedule is so different each day, that it’s hard to plan for things.

I also have ADHD and struggle with ‘hyper-focusing’. The way I procrastinate is I get too into a task. So for example, I have to create a lesson for my year 9s. There is a lesson available but I think the resources are not great and wouldn’t benefit my students. I will then ‘hyper-focus’ and spend ages creating an amazing resource that is really helpful– but then I haven’t done any of the other 15 things I needed to do. I am a ‘productive’ procrastinator…

Anyways, I ended up writing down all the things that are my responsibilities at work. How would you use Amazing Marvin to organize this?

-   Plan 4-5 lessons a day and printing resources (but each day is different–and usually the lesson will need to be adapted based on the previous lesson..and sometimes I have 5 classes, and once in a while I will only teach 2 classes)
-   Assigning and monitoring homework– I always forget what I assign…
-   Form tutor duty (breaks and lunches I have students in my classroom asking for guidance etc– I also am responsible for making sure the kids know what they need to do each day, get forms signed etc)
-   Pastoral duties – calling parents, following up with child protection issues, mentoring vulnerable students
-   Marking and Grading – Every 2 weeks I have about 10-12 hours of additional marking that needs to be completed. Student results have a hard deadline at the end of term, but I usually don’t know when those deadlines are…)
-   Various Admin duties — completing department projects, random things that pop up
-   Department meetings and after school duties- preping for meetings (I have 2-3 meetings a week that go until 5)
-   Extracurricular Programs that I run – Needs to be organised and timely…something I struggle with.
-   Training program – Assignments, long term projects, weekly meetings

Please help! Also, thank you so much for this awesome product. It has been really helpful so far.

Kind Regards,  
Teal

Dear Teal,

Wow, you sure have a lot of different responsibilities and a lot to do! But no worries, **a good system will make all that work seem much more manageable**, and I will do my best to help you find that system.

**You might want to read through this post with a notepad and jot down any idea that you want to try**. And when you are finished make a point to try one idea right away. As you try things, reflect each day what went well and what you are still struggling with. If the pain point is large enough go to your note and try another idea that could solve your problem.

Before we jump into some specific ideas, I want to point out some things to keep in mind while embarking on your journey of finding your perfect productivity system.

## Developing a Productivity System

### The right approach and mindset

There are ton of different ways to set up a productivity system. But don’t let that overwhelm you. **Any type of system is better than none, so you just have to start somewhere**.

This post should give you plenty of ideas on where to start. But don’t feel like you have to implement everything right away. One step at a time.

**The only way to find the perfect productivity system is through trial and error**. You won’t know if something works for you until you try it.

**Make sure to regularly reflect on what works well in your system and what needs improvement**. Then tweak and repeat.

**Never feel discouraged when something isn’t working**, just see it as an opportunity to try something else. You will often get valuable insights when you ask “Why is this not working?” and that will help you find a better solution.

And always **give a new strategy some time before you decide to keep, modify, or discard it.** A strategy that feels a bit clunky at first might become your new best friend once you get used to it.

## Attributes of the perfect Productivity System

## The end goal

**It’s a good idea to start off with painting a clear picture of the end goal.**

What problems specifically should your system solve for you? How should your workflow make you feel?

**Having a list of specific points gives you something to check your current system against.**

From what you wrote it sounds like a good system for you should:

-   reduce anxiety and worry about forgetting things
-   make your entire workload feel more manageable
-   help you feel in total control of your tasks
-   create a nice balance between your responsibilities
-   remove the question marks about what to do when
-   motivate you to get things done you don’t love to do
-   help you remember tasks at the right time (e.g. homework you assigned)

## One day at a time

The key to being able to manage a lot of responsibilities without feeling overwhelmed is a system that allows you to only focus on one day at a time. **If you are confronted with ALL your outstanding work each and every day you’ll quickly feel paralyzed by overwhelm.**

**So your system should allow you to contemplate one day at a time.**

Reading through all the points below should help you get lots of ideas on how to achieve that. Specifically the paragraphs on long-term planning.

## A non-overwhelming daily to-do list

Since you will be focusing on one day at a time, you want to also **make sure that your daily to-do plan is appealing to work on.**

Here are three important points that help make that happen:

-   [**Write tasty tasks** -> start with a verb, be specific, make them short](https://blog.amazingmarvin.com/three-simple-rules-writing-great-tasks-todo-list/)
-   Make a **list that is doable**. The hours scheduled should be realistic. ([time estimates can help](https://blog.amazingmarvin.com/5-benefits-of-using-time-estimates-in-your-todo-list/))
-   **Prioritize and organize** the items on your list so you can always easily figure out what to do next. Use sections, stars, due dates, and task order to do so.

## Capturing Ideas and Tasks

### A key habit for any productivity system

One important tenant of all good productivity systems is that you should never try to store things in your head. **Any idea or task should be captured in an outside system as quickly as possible**.

This keeps your head free to think and ensures you won’t forget anything.

Regularly capturing things is a habit. It will take some time to always remember to write a task or idea down. In the beginning it can help to **make a daily or weekly task “Capture tasks”** where you brainstorm things to add to your master list.

## Productivity Apps for capturing tasks and ideas

**I recommend having two places where you capture things**: one place for tasks (things that need doing soon) and one place to capture more general ideas.

#### Task manager for capturing tasks

It makes me happy to hear that you are using Amazing Marvin as your task manager. Great choice! 😉

**Any task that comes up should be immediately put into your task manager**. In Marvin you can use the #Inbox shortcut in your day view to send a task straight to your Inbox in the master list whenever you don’t want to forget a task but don’t want to do it right away. Or use the “+” sign to schedule it to a specific day (tomorrow or in a week, etc.). If you are not in the day view (e.g. Super Focus Mode) and you think of something else to do, press the spacebar to get an input field where you can send tasks to your master list from anywhere.

#### Note/document app for capturing ideas

In addition to Marvin you might also like to **use a note and document app** such as Google Drive (free) for capturing ideas.

**Whenever you have an idea for a lesson or a project, write it down in your notes**. You might get a burst of ideas for activities to do with your class or all of a sudden have a lot of ideas for test questions.

It’s great to capture those ideas as they come up in one place. Not only does it feel like a **relief to know you won’t forget them** but it will also **make your work later on a lot easier** when all you already have something to work with — especially when your notes are nice and organized.

## Marvin setup ideas

### Let’s get the party started

Let’s get into some ideas on how you can use Marvin to manage your workload and specific solutions to your problems.

**Try them out and modify them to your heart’s content**. You’ll always know best what is working for you and what isn’t.

## Master List Setup

#### Create main categories and subcategories

**The first thing to do is set up your master list.** I would make a main category for each of your responsibilities and pick a color that you associate with that type of work.

For the teaching it might also be a good idea to make a subcategory for each class you are teaching. Here is an example of what your master list might look like:

![todo list setup teacher](Dear%20Marvin%20%20Teacher%20with%20ADHD%20and%20too%20much%20to%20do%20needs%20a%20good%20system%20%20Amazing%20Marvin/Screen-Shot-2017-12-26-at-10.58.39-AM-1024x508.png)

#### Perform a Braindump

**Next you want to try and get every task and project you currently have to do out of your brain and into the master list**. Some people like to just dump it all into the Inbox first and sort it later.

#### Create projects

Once you have a nice list of all your current to-dos, **go through them and think about which one of these are actually projects**. Anything that includes multiple steps (that you can’t all do in one work session of 30-60min) or spans multiple days/weeks is a project.

#### File the tasks and projects

Sort the projects and tasks into their categories if you created them in the Inbox.

#### Assign due dates

Assign a due date to tasks and projects that have a hard deadline.

#### Prioritize

If you want to  prioritize your to-dos, turn on the prioritization strategies for tasks and projects and **mark items as red, orange, or yellow.** It might be also a good idea to quickly sort items so whatever you need to do first is on top.

#### Remember to capture tasks

**Moving forward it’s all about capturing any task that comes up in your master list** (as discussed above) and doing regular maintenance work in the master list so your tasks are always relevant.

**To help with maintenance**, you can use the **“Weekly Review”** strategy or set up a recurring task to remind you to go through the master list to delete items, create new ones, add tasks to projects, assign due dates etc. Strategies such as **“Missing Next Steps”** and **“Staleness alert”** can help you notice when something needs your attention.

## Recurring Tasks and Projects

The next thing I would do is set up recurring tasks and projects. This is super helpful to **ensure you don’t forget any regular duties.**

**Go through your list of work and think about each item and whether it could be turned into a recurring item**. The more recurring tasks the less manual adding you will have to do throughout the week and the less likely something will get forgotten.

It might make sense to create recurring tasks for things like:

-   meeting prep
-   meetings
-   lesson planning
-   making a tutor schedule
-   etc.

Don’t worry if something is technically recurring but not always exactly the same. During your weekly planning you can always delete recurring tasks or move them to a different day. And you can always modify your recurring tasks or **use saved items instead for projects that have irregular intervals.**

#### Do more non-urgent but important tasks

**Recurring tasks can be useful to get you to do thing that you technically want to do more of but are not urgent** (no external deadline, no immediate consequence of delaying it) and which therefore most often just don’t happen because there is so much else to do.

This could be things like:

-   reaching out to vulnerable students
-   brainstorming ideas for extracurricular programs

#### Making progress on long-term projects

**Recurring tasks can also help you to make sure you make regular progress on big long-term projects**. Instead of pushing it off and then completing a project all at once, set up a recurring task within a project to spend 15 to 30 min on that project daily or a few times per week. Make sure you have already broken down the project somewhere (either in a separate document or inside Marvin as tasks or notes) so you always know what to work on when it’s time to work on the project.

## Section Setup

As you probably have already figured out, in Marvin you can **break up your daily to-do list into sections**. Any kind of sections!

**The type of sections you chose can make a big difference in your daily workflow**. So definitely experiment a lot with different kind of setups. A few ideas below that you can mix and match.

#### Essential and bonus sections

One idea that might work well for you is to use one **section for tasks that absolutely have to get done today (“essential”)** and one **section for tasks that you can work on if you have time** (and energy) left over after completing all the essential tasks. You could call this section “bonus”.

#### Separate essential “at school” and “at home” tasks

You might even want to **create two separate sections for your essential tasks**, one for tasks you want to do while you are at school and one for things you do at home or after classes are done.

Alternatively, you can add labels with the location context and then filter by them depending on where you are.

#### Teaching section for in class tasks

In addition to these two sections you **could also have a section called “Teaching” where you put tasks that you want to remember while you are in class**:

-   Checking in with a specific student
-   Signing a form for someone
-   Asking about the homework assignment

Since you have several classes, it might be a good idea to add a specific label for each class to a task. So whenever you are in a class, **click the label to filter the tasks so you only see the ones relevant for that specific class.**

![Section Setup Example for a busy teacher](Dear%20Marvin%20%20Teacher%20with%20ADHD%20and%20too%20much%20to%20do%20needs%20a%20good%20system%20%20Amazing%20Marvin/Screen-Shot-2018-03-07-at-8.04.24-AM-1024x905.png)

Idea on how to set up to-do list sections

#### Extra Section Tip

**Click on a section to only see the tasks from that section**.  This helps to make your list feel less overwhelming so you can focus better on what is relevant right now. In addition to this, if you ever feel overwhelmed by multiple tasks, immediately go into the Super Focus Mode. It can make a world of difference.

## Planning your months, weeks, and days

### Doing it right

Now that the basics of your system are in place lets get into “using the system”. There are basically **two main types of activities in a work system: planning and working.**

#### Why planning matters

**Planning is all about making it easier for you to do the work later on**. You decide ahead of time what is important to do next and figure out when to do what, so that throughout the day you can focus on getting the work done.

The way you plan makes all the difference between feeling overwhelmed or calm later on and how much you actually get done. **Planning ahead also ensures that you’ll start on projects early enough and helps you spot things you need to delegate** when there is still time to do so.

## Monthly Planning

**At the start of each month it’s helpful to do a monthly planning session**. You can set up a recurring task for this to make sure you don’t forget. It also helpful to have a checklist that lists the steps you take during your monthly planning. You will build this as you go.

#### Figuring out which projects to do this month

**Monthly planning is all about figuring out what should have priority this month**. Check your calendar for deadlines of projects and figure out if it’s time to start them this month. Create a project in your Master List for everything that needs your attention this month.

#### Break large projects into monthly subprojects (milestones)

**Large projects that span past this month benefit from having a subproject** that you can complete within the next month. Think of this like a milestone you want to reach for the larger project.

#### Plan projects with the “Planning ahead” strategy

If you use the “Planning ahead” strategy (which is helpful if you have a lot of projects) you can **assign the projects you want to complete this month** to this month. You can also allocate projects to specific weeks within that month or leave that to your weekly planning. Those projects are now more easily accessible for task scheduling in your planning sidebar and in the dashboard.

#### Prepare projects for action

**Next, you can also go through each of the projects and write down some project notes and add the first step to take for each project**. This will make it easier to get started later on. Alternatively, you can do this as part of your weekly planning.

## Weekly Planning

**Each week I also recommend doing a weekly planning session.** This will make your daily planning easier. Just as for the monthly planning it can be helpful to have a checklist for your weekly planning.

#### Pick projects to focus on this week

**Figure out which projects you want to tackle this week** and allocate them accordingly if you are using the “Planning ahead” strategy. If you haven’t already it’s now time to add 1-2 next steps (tasks) to each project and try to get a better idea of what you need to do to get it done. You can even schedule some tasks to a specific day this week already.

#### Map out your week with time blocks or time goals

If you are using any of the strategies recommended below (time blocking, time goals) it makes sense to **map out your week during your weekly planning session.** 

## Daily Planning

**Planning for the next day is best done the night before**, where you have the freshest information about what is on your plate. It will also help you to feel at ease and sleep like a baby when you know that the next day is already planned.

Depending on what you did during your weekly planning you might already have most of the days scheduled. But it’s always a good idea to go through it again and make sure the day plan makes sense.

#### Don’t over-schedule your day

**When planning a day there are a few pitfalls.** The most common one is trying to cram way too much into one day. There are only so many hours one can be productive in a day, so knowing that limit and making sure you stick to it is vital.

**A too ambitious plan can overwhelm before you even get started and leaving things undone feels very demotivating**. So it’s always best to err on the side of caution and plan too little. Time estimates are great for helping you create a more realistic day plan.

**Planning a realistic day sounds simple, but in practice it is extremely difficult to do**. Our desire to get a lot done each day coupled with a natural optimism that tomorrow we’ll have endless motivation and energy makes it very difficult.

**Having a bonus section is often a good compromise**. It allows you to add a lot of tasks to your day that you want to get done, but it feels less bad when you don’t finish all of them as they were “bonus” anyway.

When planning your day it is also very important to **leave enough leeway for spontaneous events and tasks that come up**. Try to get a feel for how much of your day is taken up with these kinds of things and leave room in your calculations for those events.

#### Have a system for day planning

**A common problem with day planning is not knowing what to do.**  I go into a couple solutions for this dilemma in the section “Deciding what to do each day & finding balance” below. But if you figured out what projects to focus on this week, then picking tasks for your day should already be a lot easier.

When picking tasks for your day, you can click on the “This week” tab to see your projects for this week.

## Solutions for your unique productivity challenges

You mentioned a couple of specific challenges you face. Here are a couple of ideas on how to tackle them.

## Hyperfocusing on specific tasks at the expense of others

Being able to hyperfocus on a task as someone with ADHD means that you find that task interesting and stimulating. Which is great! But of course, the challenge is to not get so lost in those tasks that you neglect everything else.

#### Reward yourself with interesting tasks

Try to **use those interesting tasks to motivate yourself to do other tasks.** Make a rule that whenever you feel excited about a task, you must get something else done first. The stimulating task will then act as a reward for getting something you dread done. This can be highly motivating!

#### Use timers

To ensure you don’t get lost in the fun task, **set a time limit ahead of time and use a timer.**  Depending on the length of the task, try to aim for 30-60min reward sessions. Once the timer goes off you have to complete another must-do task before allowing yourself to continue working on your task of choice.

**As an added bonus, the time limit will also help to you to not get lost so much in unimportant details** because you will want to make as much progress as you can within the time limit.

## Plan projects in advance and make it a point to get started on the first task right away

**Sometimes projects that are not part of our regular workday routine can be a real struggle to work on.** But there are a few things you can do to ensure those projects don’t get left behind.

#### Setting up a project

**Make project planning part of your monthly or weekly review**. Each month think about what projects are on your plate. Create them in Marvin as a project so they become real. Then assign a due date if they have a deadline.

Next, **it’s important to make it easier for your future self to actually work on this project**. Think about the individual steps you have to take to complete this project and write those steps down. You can either add them as tasks to the project in Marvin or write them down into the project note (turn on notes strategy) first. [Breaking down a large project](https://blog.amazingmarvin.com/break-large-projects-tasks-bite-sized-tasks/) is sometimes easier in a text document where you can edit and group things quickly.

With big projects it can be difficult to anticipate all the tasks that will come up. And upi don’t have to think of _all_ the steps ahead of time. But make sure you always **have at least 1-2 tasks inside the project that are the next steps** you have to take in order to make progress on that project.

#### Planning time to work on the project

Once you’ve outlined the project, you’ll probably have a better idea of how long it will take you to do the project. **You can now calculate how much time you should spend on this project each week or day to get it completed in a timely fashion.** Generally, it is best to build in a lot of leeway (add 30-50% of your first estimate).

**During your weekly review, plan when you’ll spend the necessary time on that project this week**. Pick the next step and add it to a day where you have some time. You could use the time blocking strategy here, where you map out your fixed commitments (lessons, lesson planning, tutoring, leisure, etc.) and then figure out if there is a slot available for working on projects that week. This will help you see if you actually have enough time to do it all by yourself.

As mentioned earlier, you could also **set up a recurring task to work a bit each day or week on a project.**

#### Get started as soon as possible

**Getting started is always the hardest part**. If you know you have a project to do but wait to get started, the hurdle to work on that project will become larger and larger each day that passes. So getting started as soon as possible is key.

**Try to get started (even if it is just 10min) on the project as soon as possible**. Outline one step to take and take it right after you are done planning. This will make it much easier in the future to continue working on the project.

## Deciding what to do each day & finding balance

With so many different responsibilities it is no wonder that you struggle with analysis paralysis. **Wondering what you should be working on is a really big productivity killer and stress producer**. So getting a handle on that is a top priority.

**You want to have a simple set of rules that you can stick to while planning your months, weeks, and days**. The key is to set up the right rules.

**Good rules will be easy and clear to follow** so you don’t struggle with making decisions. And good rules will automatically create the right balance for you.

#### Themed days

Some people swear by having themed days. Besides your regular daily work of teaching and lesson planning you could say **Monday is “Admin day” , Wednesday is “Training day” and Friday is “Extracurricular Programs day”**. This allows you to not think about part of your workload for most days, which helps to make it feel more manageable on a day-to-day basis. It also reduces your choices for your daily planning so there is less question about when to do what as a large part is already taken care of by the day themes.

There is no specific way to implement day themes in Marvin yet (coming later this year). But you could type in the theme of the day into each day note on top of your to-do list as part of your weekly planning.

![Themed days productivity strategy](Dear%20Marvin%20%20Teacher%20with%20ADHD%20and%20too%20much%20to%20do%20needs%20a%20good%20system%20%20Amazing%20Marvin/Screen-Shot-2018-03-07-at-8.18.55-AM-1024x217.png)

Use the day note to implement the themed days strategy

#### Time blocking

If having themed days does not work well, maybe try the more flexible approach of time blocking. **Map out your week as part of the weekly planning with time blocks**. Start with the fixed commitments (lessons, meeting) and then add in time to work on different projects and areas of responsibility.

You can see the time totals for each category on the left. This lets you adjust your plan so you can **make sure each area has the right time dedicated to it based on your current workload.**

**Experiment with time block size and day variability.** Some people like to have only a few different time blocks per day, others like to have a large variety each day to keep them interested. **Be mindful of what you are going for and why.**

#### Daily time targets

A similar idea to time blocks but without the pre-committed time associated with it can be achieved with time targets for each day.

**Turn on the “Daily time targets” strategy and set up on which days you want to spend how much time on your categories or projects.** Then during the day try to meet the time goals via time tracking your tasks.

![Setting up Time Targets in Amazing Marvin](Dear%20Marvin%20%20Teacher%20with%20ADHD%20and%20too%20much%20to%20do%20needs%20a%20good%20system%20%20Amazing%20Marvin/Screen-Shot-2018-03-06-at-4.52.57-PM-1024x304.png)

Having time track targets for each day can help to create a good balance between responsibilities.

**Just as with time blocking, experiment with variability** until you find something that works well for you. For example you might only want to set up time goals for work categories that you struggle to get started on or find a good balance in and leaving out the teaching and lesson planning, which you will do anyway.

And as always, **tweak everything until you find something that works well for you**. Experiment with the target size (30 min or 90 min etc.), the weekdays and combination of categories you like to work on for each day.

**This strategy often works well for people with ADHD**, since the almost game like nature of trying to meet a time goal is challenging and can add some extra stimulation.

![Time targets visible on top of your todo list](Dear%20Marvin%20%20Teacher%20with%20ADHD%20and%20too%20much%20to%20do%20needs%20a%20good%20system%20%20Amazing%20Marvin/Screen-Shot-2018-03-06-at-4.55.28-PM-1024x287.png)

Seeing the time targets on top of your to-do list helps with motivation

## Keeping track of homework assignments

**If you plan homework ahead of time** set up a document or spreadsheet on Google Drive where you write down the description of the homework, the class, assignment and collection date. An ideal time to do this is during lesson planning.

Immediately after creating the homework plan, **create a task for each of the homework assignments with a label for the class and schedule it for the day the homework needs to be collected**.

![Tasks to remember to collect homework on the due date](Dear%20Marvin%20%20Teacher%20with%20ADHD%20and%20too%20much%20to%20do%20needs%20a%20good%20system%20%20Amazing%20Marvin/Collect_Homework-1024x333.png)

**You could even set a reminder inside Marvin**. To do that turn on the reminder strategy, add a specific time to be reminded as part of the task title and set the reminder for the time you usually collect homework. And make sure to have the sound on.

If you do not plan homework assignments ahead of time, **create the task to collect the homework as soon as you assign the homework.**

## Extra Strategy recommendations

## Using Time Estimates

When we have more to do than there are hours in the day, **building our time awareness and managing our time is of utmost importance.**

I would encourage you to **turn on the time estimate strategy** for a while and so you can assign a time estimate to any task you create.

It does make adding tasks take a few seconds longer (but it’s really easy to do in Marvin) but the [benefits you reap from using time estimates](https://blog.amazingmarvin.com/5-benefits-of-using-time-estimates-in-your-todo-list/) are enormous.

After a while when you feel like you have become more aware of how long things take, you can stop using the time estimates strategy.

![benefits of using time estimates in your todo list](Dear%20Marvin%20%20Teacher%20with%20ADHD%20and%20too%20much%20to%20do%20needs%20a%20good%20system%20%20Amazing%20Marvin/time_estimate_title-1024x301.png)

Estimated task durations help to keep your daily to-do list in check

## Closing Thoughts

I hope that this will give you lots of ideas on how to build your own productivity system.

**Remember it is all about continuously tweaking the system**. Whenever something doesn’t feel smooth try to identify the problem and come up with some ideas for solutions to try. You know you are on the right track when your workload starts to feel more manageable and you feel a sense of control.

As new features come out in Marvin, read through their description and integrate them to solve pain points and improve things further
