# Why do people procrastinate? a list of 100+ reasons | Amazing Marvin

> ## Excerpt
> Why do people procrastinate?

Let's face it we all procrastinate sometimes (or often), even though we don't want to.

We might even be fully aware of how much it is hurting us.

So why do we procrastinate, when rationally it makes no sense to do so?

In short: emotions...

While we like to think of ourselves as rational beings (thanks prefrontal cortex!) our emotions still greatly influence our behavior.

When a task elicits negative emotions in us, we want to avoid the task. It is our natural instinct to avoid things that trigger negative emotions. The whole point of negative emotions is to help us avoid danger and problems!

We are driven to do what feels good to us in the moment. That is the basic and ancient motivation mechanism of our brain.

Unfortunately for us, there are lots of ways a task can make us feel bad and trigger that age-old avoidance instinct, even though most tasks have no risk of actually killing us or even greatly harming us.

Sometimes it's the actual task that is unpleasant and makes us feel bad.

Other times it's the potential outcome of the task that triggers a negative emotion. It can also happen that we just have a negative association with that task that is causing us to feel bad about it.

Most often it's a mix of things that triggers the negative emotions.

Usually, we are not aware of exactly why we are avoiding something. We just experience the resistance. That gnarly feeling that just makes you want to do anything but the dreaded task. Some people are very aware of the resistance and others just avoid things instinctively without even realizing they are avoiding something.

If there is a task you procrastinate again and again it can help to try and uncover what about this task triggers negative emotions in you. Sometimes that is enough to make you realize how irrational your instinct to avoid the task is and you can then consciously override this instinct and get started on the task.

Other times, being aware of what exactly triggers the negative emotions provides valuable insight into something you should work on: an unhealthy mindset or an unresolved problem.

And sometimes you might realize that you actually do have a really good reason for not wanting to do a task and you should not attempt to do that task in the first place.

Below you will find a list of 127 nuanced reasons why a task might trigger procrastination.

If there is a task you are avoiding right now, go through the list and see if something hits a nerve.
