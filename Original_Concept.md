# Original Concept

Actually just thought...

i am using file juggler to move the files from where the start to d:/
File juggler allows me to run a command which I assume to be okay to run a python script through...
So would it be possible to have a python script that would just do the parsing from the txt to the md.
including adding the links into this.

So when the files are moved into place there is a process that can trigger them automatically and end up with the parse markdown along side the file. eg.
python parseChat2Markdown.py D:/Chat/talia-tokugawa/chat/2024-03-02chat .
