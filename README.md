# Pylon

## ...because it's python and nylon is a kinda fabric

Well I really like [Fabric by Daniel Miessler](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric). But there was lots of simple little things that I didn't think it was really worth burning tokens over when a perfectly good python script could do the same thing for.

The premise here is that I am creating a whole load of additional functions you can use. I was half tempted to looking doing fabric for node red or something... but for the moment i am just seeing how things go.

You might notice that a lot of what I am doing is specifically related to parsing chat logs from Second Life. It's just be a long term project I been meaning to get around to.
