```
# Open the file containing the timestamps
with open('timestamps.txt', 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()

# Process each line to change the timestamp format
new_lines = []
for line in lines:
    # Splitting the timestamp from the rest of the line if necessary
    parts = line.strip().split(' ')
    timestamp = parts[0]
    # Extracting date and time from the timestamp
    date, time = timestamp[1:-1].split(' ')
    # Reformatting the timestamp
    new_timestamp = f"[{date}] ({time})"
    # Reconstructing the line if there was more content beyond the timestamp
    new_line = ' '.join([new_timestamp] + parts[1:])
    new_lines.append(new_line)

# Write the modified lines back to a new file or overwrite the old one

Can this be modified so that it can be run as a command from CLI and would accept text inserted into and output the resulting text in a way that it could be chained with other commands? I would also like to be able to run this as a command, eventually having a series of inputs from different sources, then any number of processes like the below that could be chained together in any order and finally a selection of outputs that would all for output in whatever format I choose. 

So for example I could have running on command line:
`read chat_2024-03-20.txt; d = get_date; ( extract_wisdom | save $d_wisdom ); ( extract_tracks | save_CSV $d_playlist ); (extract_names | update_names); ( chatlog_timestamp | chatlog_linknames | clean_chatlog | save $d_chatlog);`

This I hope would be about to:
* read - take a text file read it and pass on the info. This should make sure every line has a timestamp to start with if the line doesn't then it should be appended to the previous line so some form of eencoded linebreak
* d = get_date - would extract the date from the chatlog and save that as a variable
* extract_wisdom - make use of the fabric patterns natively
* save $d_wisdom - use fabrics save system.
* extract_tracks - custom python to extract a list of tracks from a chat log
* save_CSV - reformat a list so it's valid csv
* extract_names - go through a chat log and extract a list of names
* update_names - update a prexisting csv from a list and only add in the new unique names
* chatlog_timestamp - reformat all the timestamps in a file based on a particular setting
* chatlog_linknames - determine all the names within a file, confirming them with a csv, then reformat them so that they are formated in a particular way.
* clean_chatlog - remove everthing except for actual chat from recognised people.

Some other possible modules:
* extract_debug - pull just the debug infomation from chat.
* filter_people - extract just the conversations from particular people
* split_by_conversation - break apart the chatlog so that if is just conversations each different conversation could be saved to a file of its own. Dependant on particpants and context.
* filter_context - extract just the conversatiosn about a particular subject.
* extract_tasks - pull out a list of tasks/actions from a conversation
* inject_obs_* - Any one of a number of things but would insert particular things directly into an obsidian vault to specific locations.
* extract_events - extract all the events mentioned from chat
* export_ics - generate calendar events
* get_sl_user - from a username goto a specific page and scrape info from it for that user.
* save_sql - save data in sql format.
* export_sql - insert data direct into database
* chatlog_to_table - break down a chatlog into a table format  
etc.

Note this is all using the standard CLI syntax... 
Can you make sure the above will work as I am looking for it to work?
If you want to start generating other modules go ahead. 
And if you have guidance on where to go from here, that would be good.
